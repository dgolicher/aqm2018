	Abstract = {Criticisms of null-hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) are reviewed. Used as formal, two-valued decision procedures, they often generate misleading conclusions. However, critics who argue that NHSTs are totally meaningless because the null hypothesis is virtually always false are overstating their case. Critics also neglect the whole class of valuable significance tests that assess goodness of fit of models to data. Even as applied to simple mean differences, NHSTs can be rhetorically useful in defending research against criticisms that random factors adequately explain the results, or that the direction of mean difference was not demonstrated convincingly. Principled argument and counterargument produce the lore, or communal understanding, in a field, which in turn helps guide new research. Alternative procedures-confidence intervals, effect sizes, and meta-analysis-are discussed. Although these alternatives are not totally free from criticism either, they deserve more frequent use, without an unwise ban on NHSTs.},

We assume that readers are familiar with the information-theoretic approaches and provide several examples of misuse.

@Article{Anderson2000,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a review and critique of statistical null hypothesis testing in ecological studies in general, and wildlife studies in particular, and describes an alternative. Our review of Ecology and the journal of Wildlife Management found the use of null hypothesis testing to be pervasive. The estimated number of P-values appearing within articles of Ecology exceeded 8,000 in 1991 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1984, whereas the estimated number of P-values in the Journal of Wildlife Management exceeded 8,000 in 1997 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1991. We estimated that 47% (SE = 3.9%) of the P-values in the Journal of Wildlife;fe Management lacked estimates of means or effect sizes or even the sign of the difference in means or other parameters. We find that null hypothesis testing is uninformative when no estimates of means or effect size and their precision are given. Contrary to common dogma, tests of statistical null hypotheses have relatively little utility in science and are not a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. We recommend their use be reduced in favor of more informative approaches. Towards this objective, we describe a relatively new paradigm of data analysis based on Kullback-Leibler information. This paradigm is an extension of likelihood theory and, when used correctly, avoids many of the fundamental limitations and common misuses of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic methods focus on providing a strength of evidence for an a priori set of alternative hypotheses, rather than a statistical test of a null hypothesis. This paradigm allows the following types of evidence for the alternative hypotheses: the rank of each hypothesis, expressed as a model; an estimate of the formal likelihood of each model, given the data; a measure of precision that incorporates model selection uncertainty; and simple methods to allow the use of the set of alternative models in making formal inference. We provide an example of the information-theoretic approach using data on the effect of lead on survival in spectacled elder ducks (Somateria fischeri). Regardless of the analysis paradigm used, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be clearly separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging.},

The information-theoretic and Bayesian methods offer alternative approaches to data analysis and inference compared to traditionally used methods.

We contend, however, that monitoring treatment effects on wildlife should be an integral component of the design and execution of any management activity, including restoration. Thus, we provide a conceptual framework for the design and implementation of monitoring studies to understand the effects of restoration on wildlife. Our underlying premise is that effective monitoring hinges on an appropriate study design for unbiased and precise estimates of the response variables. We advocate using measures of population dynamics for response variables given that they provide the most direct measures of wildlife status and trends. The species to be monitored should be those constituting an assemblage of umbrella species that represent the range of spatial and functional requirements of wildlife in a restored ecological system. Selection of umbrella species should be based on strong empirical evidence that justifies their usage. We also advocate that monitoring be designed as true experiments or quasi-experiments rather than as observational studies to allow for stronger inferences regarding the effects of restoration on wildlife. Our primary message is that if monitoring is to be done, it must be scientifically based.},

The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models.

	Abstract = {We describe an information-theoretic paradigm for analysis of ecological data, based on Kullback-Leibler information, that is an extension of likelihood theory and avoids the pitfalls of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model (g(i)), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. L(g(i)\textbackslashdata)). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference can be based on all the models in the a priori set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).},

There are several things researchers can do to minimize the importance of statistical significance testing and get articles published without using these tests. First, they can insert statistically in front of significant in research reports. Second, results can be interpreted before p values are reported. Third, effect sizes can be reported along with measures of sampling error. Fourth, replication can be built into the design. The touting of insignificant results as significant because they are statistically significant is not likely to change until researchers break the stranglehold that statistical significance testing has on journal editors.},

	Abstract = {The null-hypothesis significance-test procedure (NHSTP) is defended in the context of the theory-corroboration experiment, as well as the following contrasts: (a) substantive hypotheses versus statistical hypotheses, (b) theory corroboration versus statistical hypothesis testing, (c) theoretical inference versus statistical decision, (d) experiments versus nonexperimental studies, and (e) theory corroboration versus treatment assessment. The null hypothesis can be true because it is the hypothesis that errors are randomly distributed in data. Moreover, the null hypothesis is never used as a categorical proposition. Statistical significance means only that chance influences can be excluded as an explanation of data; it does not identify the nonchance factor responsible. The experimental conclusion is drawn with the inductive principle underlying the experimental design. A chain of deductive arguments gives rise to the theoretical conclusion via the experimental conclusion. The anomalous relationship between statistical significance and the effect size often used to criticize NHSTP is more apparent than real. The absolute size of the effect is not an index of evidential support for the substantive hypothesis. Nor is the effect size, by itself, informative as to the practical importance of the the research result. Being a conditional probability, statistical power cannot be the a priori probability of statistical significance. The validity of statistical power is debatable because statistical significance is determined with a single sampling distribution of the test statistic based on H-0, whereas it takes two distributions to represent statistical power or effect size. Sample size should not be determined in the mechanical manner envisaged in power analysis. It is inappropriate to criticize NHSTP for nonstatistical reasons. At the same time, neither effect size, nor confidence interval estimate, nor posterior probability can be used to exclude chance as an explanation of data. Neither can any of them fulfill the nonstatistical functions expected of them by critics.},

Attempts to persuade researchers to augment this information, with details such as effect size and confidence intervals, and in particular to take the probability of a Type II error into account, have largely been ignored. The present paper reviews the degree to which statistical power has been explicitly considered in papers published in the British Journal of Psychology in 1993 and 1994. It summarizes the power for small, medium and large effect sizes for 54 papers, based on the sample sizes which were employed. The analysis confirms that the power of statistical tests is not taken into account by researchers and that, accordingly, they continue to run a high risk of rejecting their research hypotheses.},

This article suggests that an ordinal statistic, d, is often more appropriate. d compares the number of times a score from one group or condition is higher than one from the other, compared with the reverse. Compared to mean comparisons, d is more robust and equally or more powerful; it is invariant under transformation. and it often conforms more closely to the experimenter{'}s research hypothesis. It is suggested that inferences from d be based on sample estimates of its variance rather than on the more traditional assumption of identical distributions. The statistic is extended to simple repeated measures designs, and ways of extending its use to more complex designs are suggested.},

Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods is suggested.

	Abstract = {Meehl and Rosen (1955) observed that their colleagues tended to equate the sensitivity of a sign (its probability given a diagnostic category) with its predictive accuracy (the probability of the diagnostic category given the sign). Such equating of inverse probabilities implies ignoring base rates. Later, many researchers demonstrated such neglect in a number of experimental contexts involving hypothetical judgments; others have found some use of base rates-but only when base rates were supplied by the experimenter, in which case even irrelevant base rates influenced judgment. The present study tested for equating conditional probabilities in a context similar to the contexts involved in the initial observations-that is, subjects strove for accuracy rather than attempted to make good judgments about hypothetical problems, and the base rates were generated by the subjects themselves. Neglect of base rates was revealed by within-individual comparisons showing subjects equated inverse probabilities without equating the corresponding unconditional ones.},

	Abstract = {Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.},

	Abstract = {According to almost any approach to statistical inference, attained significance levels, or p values, have little value. Despite this consensus among statistical experts, p values are usually reported extensively in research articles in a manner that invites misinterpretation. In the present article, I suggest that the reason p values are so heavily used is because they provide information concerning the strength of the evidence provided by the experiment. In some typical hypothesis testing situations, researchers may be interested in the relative adequacy of two different theoretical accounts: one that predicts no difference across conditions, and another that predicts some difference. The appropriate statistic for this kind of comparison is the likelihood ratio, P(D/M-0)/P(D/M-1), where M-0 and M-1 are the two theoretical accounts. Large values of the likelihood ratio provide evidence that M-0 is a better account, whereas small values indicate that M-1 is better. I demonstrate that, under some circumstances, the p value can be interpreted in the same manner as the likelihood ratio. Ln particular, for Z, t, and sign tests, the likelihood ratio is an approximately linear function of the p value, with a slope between 2 and 3. Thus, researchers may report p values in scientific communications because they are a proxy for the likelihood ratio and provide the readers with information about the strength of the evidence that is not otherwise available.},

	Abstract = {In our statistical practice, we ecologists work comfortably within the hypothetico-deductive epistemology of Popper and the frequentist statistical methodology of Fisher. Consequently, our null hypotheses do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as {`}{'}we reject the null hypothesis st the 0.05 level,{''} which reflect the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities, based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a Bayesian mode also are mon meaningful in environmental policy discussions: e.g., {`}{'}our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests.{''} Based on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue that a {`}{'}Bayesian ecology{''} would (a) make better use of pre-existing data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental decision-making.},

It is representative of a class of probability puzzles where the correct solution depends on explication of underlying assumptions. Spontaneous beliefs concerning the problem and intuitive heuristics are reviewed. The psychological background of these beliefs is explored. Several attempts to find a simple criterion to predict whether and how the probability of the target event will change as a result of obtaining evidence are examined. However, despite the psychological appeal of these attempts, none proves to be valid in general. A necessary and sufficient condition for change in the probability of the target event, following observation of new data, is proposed. That criterion is an extension of the likelihood-ratio principle (which holds in the case of only two complementary alternatives) to any number of alternatives. Some didactic implications concerning the significance of the chance set-up and reliance on analogies are discussed.},

In this situation, the fixed-sample stopping rule, in which the number of subjects is determined in advance, is impractical and inefficient. This article presents a sequential stopping rule that is practical and about 30% more efficient: Once a minimum number of subjects is tested, stop with p less than .01 or greater than .36; otherwise, keep testing. This procedure keeps alpha at .05 and can be adjusted to fit researchers{'} needs and inclinations.},

	Abstract = {The many criticisms of null hypothesis testing suggest when it is not useful and what is should not be used for. This article explores when and why its use is appropriate. Null hypothesis testing is insufficient when size of effect is important, but it is ideal for testing ordinal claims relating the order of conditions, which are common in psychology. Null hypothesis testing also is insufficient for determining beliefs, but it is ideal for demonstrating sufficient evidential strength to support an ordinal claim, with sufficient evidence being 1 criterion for a finding entering the corpus of legitimate findings in psychology. The line between sufficient and insufficient evidence is currently set at p < .05; there is little reason for allowing experimenters to select their own value of alpha. Thus null hypothesis testing is an optimal method for demonstrating sufficient evidence for an ordinal claim.},

Despite frequent opinions to the contrary, this null hypothesis can be correct in some situations. Appropriate criteria for accepting the null hypothesis are (1) that the null hypothesis is possible; (2) that the results are consistent with the null hypothesis; and (3) that the experiment was a good effort to find an effect. These criteria are consistent with the meta-rules for psychology. The good-effort criterion is subjective, which is somewhat undesirable, but the alternative-never accepting the null hypothesis-is neither desirable nor practical.},

If such a man tests positive, the chance that he is infected can be as low as 50%. We study what information counsellors communicate to clients concerning the meaning of a positive test and whether they communicate this information in a way the client can understand. To get realistic data, one of us visited as a client 20 public health centres in Germany to rake 20 counselling sessions and HIV tests, A majority of the counsellors explained that false positives do not occur, and half of the counsellors told the client that if he tests positive, it is 100% certain that he is infected with the virus. Counsellors communicated numerical information in terms of probabilities rather than absolute frequencies, became confused, and were inconsistent. Based on experimental evidence, we propose a simple method that counsellors can learn to communicate risks in a more effective way.},

Although we agree with most critics{'} catalogs of NHT{'}s flaws, this article also takes the unusual stance of identifying virtues that may explain why NHT continues to be so extensively used. These virtues include providing results in the form of a dichotomous (yes/no) hypothesis evaluation and providing an index (p value) that has a justifiable mapping onto confidence in repeatability of a null hypothesis rejection. The most-criticized flaws of NHT can be avoided when the importance of a hypothesis, rather than the p value of its test, is used to determine that a finding is worthy of report, and when p congruent to .05 is treated as insufficient basis for confidence in the replicability of an isolated non-null finding. Together with many recent critics of NHT, we also urge reporting of important hypothesis tests in enough descriptive detail to permit secondary uses such as meta-analysis.},

	Abstract = {Null-hypothesis significance tests (NHST), properly used,tell us whether we have sufficient evidence to be confident of the sign of the population effect-but only if we abandon two-valued logic in favor of Kaiser{'}s (1960) three-alternative hypothesis tests. Confidence intervals provide a useful addition to NHSTs, and can be used to provide the same sign-determination function as NHST. However, when so used, confidence intervals are subject to exactly the same Type I, II, and III error rates as NHST. In addition, NHSTs provide two pieces of information about our data-maximum probability of a Type III error and probability of a successful exact replication-that confidence intervals do not. The proposed alternative to NHST is just as susceptible to misinterpretation as is NHST. The problem of bias due to censoring of data collection or publication can be handled by providing archives for all methodologically sound data sets, but reserving interpretations and conclusions for statistically significant results.},

	Abstract = {For a wide range of tests of single-df hypotheses, the sample size needed to achieve 50% power is readily approximated by setting N such that a significance test conducted on data that fit one{'}s assumptions perfectly just barely achieves statistical significance at one{'}s chosen alpha level. If the effect size assumed in establishing one{'}s N is the minimally important effect size (i.e., that effect size such that population differences or correlations smaller than that are not any practical or theoretical significance, whether statistically significant or not), then 50% power is optimal, because the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis should be greater than .5 when the population difference is of practical or theoretical significance but lower than .5 when it is not. Moreover, the actual power of the test in this case will be considerably higher than .5, exceeding .95 for a population difference two or more times as large as the minimally important difference (MID). This minimally important difference significant (MIDS) criterion extends naturally to specific comparisons following (or substituting for) overall tests such as the ANOVA F and chi-square for contingency tables, although the power of the overall test (i.e., the probability of finding some statistically significant specific comparison) is considerably greater than .5 when the MIDS criterion is applied to the overall test. However, the proper focus for power computations is one or more specific comparisons (rather than the omnibus test), and the MIDS criterion is well suited to setting sample size on this basis. Whereas N(MIDS) (the sample size specified by the MIDS criterion) is much too small for the case in which we wish to prove the modified H0 that there is no important population effect, it nonetheless provides a useful metric for specifying the necessary sample size. In particular, the sample size needed to have a 1 - alpha probability that the (1 - alpha)-level confidence interval around one{'}s population parameter includes no important departure from H0 is four times N(MIDS) when H0 is true and approximately [4/(1 - b)2]. N(MIDS) when b (the ratio between the actual population difference and the minimally important difference) is between zero and unity. The MIDS criterion for sample size provides a useful alternative to the methods currently most commonly employed and taught.},

We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies. These statistical methods hold promise for new insight in ecology by encouraging thoughtful model building as part of inquiry, providing a unified framework for the empirical analysis of theoretical models, and by facilitating the formal accumulation of evidence bearing on fundamental questions.},

Just how popular is significance testing in psychology? This issue is examined in the present historical study, which uses data from randomly selected issues of the Journal of Applied Psychology for the period 1917-94. Results indicate that the practice of significance testing, at one time of restricted usage, has expanded to the point that it is virtually synonymous with empirical analysis. The data also lend support to Gigerenzer and Murray{'}s (1987) allegation that an inference revolution occurred in psychology during the period 1940-55. Unfortunately, it is concluded that the ubiquity of significance testing constitutes a classic example of the overadoption of a methodology.},

It was of interest to discover textbook coverage of the P-value (i.e., Fisher) and fixed-alpha (i.e., Neyman-Pearson) approaches to statistical testing. Also of interest in the review were some issues and concerns related to the practice and teaching of statistical testing: (a) levels of significance, (b) importance of effects, (c) statistical power and sample size, and (d) multiple testing.

The significance test has devastated the research review process. Comprehensive reviews cite conflicting results on almost every issue. Yet quantitatively accurate review of the same,results shows that the apparent conflicts stem almost entirely from the high error rate for the significance test.

The present investigation was designed to illustrate the potential limitations of meta-analysis for making causal inferences. Several meta-analytic investigations have led others to conclude that gender differences are getting smaller over time, however, there has been little concern regarding changes in research methodology over time. The present findings indicate that the gender differences in aggression appear to be remarkably stable when changes in study characteristics over time are controlled. The authors discuss the implications for the use of meta-analytic procedures to make causal inferences and the implications for understanding the causes of gender differences.},

As a result, most programmes are likely to fail to reach the necessary standard of being capable of rejecting a false null hypothesis with reasonable power. Results from inadequate monitoring are misleading for their information quality and are dangerous because they create the illusion that something useful has been done. We propose that conservation agencies and those funding monitoring work should require the demonstration of adequate power at the outset of any new monitoring scheme. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject x condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor (square root 2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that a Fisherian approach to statistical inference, which views statistical testing as determining the chance probability of an event, is coherent, consistent with modern statistical methods and forms a sound theoretical basis for the use of statistical tests in psychology. It is argued that Fisherian statistical tests are concerned with establishing the direction of tested effects, give rise to confidence intervals and are quite consistent with power analyses. Researchers are encouraged to report chance probabilities, and to interpret them according to the prevailing conditions rather than using a fixed decision rule. The contrasting Neyman-Pearson approach, which Views statistical testing as a quality control procedure for accepting hypotheses, posits unreasonable research practices which psychologists do not and should not be expected to follow. Neyman-Pearson theory has caused confusion in the psychological literature and criticisms have been levelled at statistical testing in general that ought to have been directed specifically at Neyman-Pearson testing. Statistical inference, of any sore, is held to be insufficient to characterize the process of testing scientific hypotheses. Data should be seen as evidence to be used in psychological arguments and statistical significance is just one measure of its quality. It restrains researchers from making too much of findings which could otherwise be explained by chance.},

We focus on two estimators of relative abundance, which assume that the probability that an individual is detected at least once in the survey is either equal or unequal for the two populations. We present three methods for incorporating the collected information into our inference. The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equivalence testing, is one approach to doing so. Third, we suggest that model averaging could be used by combining the two estimators according to derived model weights. These differing approaches are applied to a mark-recapture experiment on Nuttall{'}s cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus nuttallii) conducted in central Oregon during 1974 and 1975, which has been previously analyzed by other authors.},

The lack of a definitive empirical basis to resolve issues of assessment and diagnostic bias means that the null hypothesis (no bias or cross-cultural uniformity) prevails. This article argues that the traditional hypothesis to be nullified should be challenged. The consequences associated with its incorrect retention (Type II error = disservice to minority clients) may be more serious than its incorrect rejection (Type I error = misdirection to the mental health service system). If a client-centered error is judged more serious than a service system error, then a statement of bias or crosscultural variance should be the null hypothesis until such time as empirical data suggest otherwise.},

	Abstract = {The ecological processes that create spatial patterns have been examined by direct measurement and through measurement of patterns resulting from experimental manipulations. But in many situations, creating experiments and direct measurement of spatial processes can be difficult or impossible. Here, we identify and de. ne a rapidly emerging alternative approach, which we formalize as {``}space as a surrogate{''} for unmeasured processes, that is used to maximize inference about ecological processes through the analysis of spatial patterns or spatial residuals alone. This approach requires three elements to be successful: a priori hypotheses, ecological theory and/or knowledge, and precise spatial analysis. We offer new insights into a long-standing debate about process-pattern links in ecology and highlight six recent studies that have successfully examined spatial patterns to understand a diverse array of processes: competition in forest-stand dynamics, dispersal of freshwater fish, movement of American marten, invasion mechanisms of exotic trees, dynamics of natural disturbances, and tropical-plant diversity. Key benefits of using space as a surrogate can be found where experimental manipulation or direct measurements are difficult or expensive to obtain or not possible. We note that, even where experiments can be performed, this procedure may aid in measuring the in situ importance of the processes uncovered through experiments.},

This paper introduces a Bayesian model selection approach that formalizes Occam{'}s razor, choosing the simplest model that describes the data well. The choice of a model is carried out by taking into account not only the traditional model selection criteria (i.e., a model{'}s fit to the data and the number of parameters) but also the extension of the parameter space, and, most importantly, the functional form of the model (i.e., the way in which the parameters are combined in the model{'}s equation). An advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of non-nested models as well as nested ones. Application examples are presented and implications of the results for evaluating models of cognition are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Behavioural ecologists often study complex systems in which multiple hypotheses could be proposed to explain observed phenomena. For some systems, simple controlled experiments can be employed to reveal part of the complexity; often, however, observational studies that incorporate a multitude of causal factors may be the only (or preferred) avenue of study. We assess the value of recently advocated approaches to inference in both contexts. Specifically, we examine the use of information theoretic (IT) model selection using Akaike{'}s information criterion (AIC). We find that, for simple analyses, the advantages of switching to an IT-AIC approach are likely to be slight, especially given recent emphasis on biological rather than statistical significance. By contrast, the model selection approach embodied by IT approaches offers significant advantages when applied to problems of more complex causality. Model averaging is an intuitively appealing extension to model selection. However, we were unable to demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction accuracy when using model averaging with IT-AIC; our equivocal results suggest that more research is needed on its utility. We illustrate our arguments with worked examples from behavioural experiments.},

	Abstract = {Statistical tests define rules of evidence in psychological science. Agreed-upon rules of evidence ar-e needed to discuss what is true. Statistics are probability statements about the reliability of associations. In public and journalistic debates about psychological topics, the need for statistical rules is evident. Anecdotes, intuitions, and sensational and unlikely events often dominate popular discussions. Psychological science demands that the probability of events and associations be evaluated by statistical means. Understanding of statistical tests can be improved by abandoning the term significance, which means reliability to psychologists, but in everyday English, means importance. The importance of a result depends on magnitude of association, nor on whether the event has a nonzero chance of recurring. Given large samples and multiple measures, statistical rests are used too often to draw misleading conclusions about the importance of research results. Better uses of statistics would focus on the magnitude of effects and error estimates.},

It is now possible to use meta-analysis to show that reliance on significance testing retards the development of cumulative knowledge. But reform of teaching and practice will also require that researchers learn that the benefits that they believe flow from use of significance testing are illusory. Teachers must revamp their courses to bring students to understand that (a) reliance on significance testing retards the growth of cumulative research knowledge; (b) benefits widely believed to flow from significance testing do not in fact exist; and (c) significance testing methods must be replaced with point estimates and confidence intervals in individual studies and with meta-analyses in the integration of multiple studies.

Statistical significance does not speak to the probability that the null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is true or false, to the probability that a result would be replicated, or to treatment effects, nor is it a valid indicator of the magnitude or the importance of a result.

	Abstract = {In spite of arguments to the contrary, psychologists, it is shown here, believe statistical significance (SS) signifies that a finding will replicate. The most visible argument that SS is not an index of replicability, one that is based in notions of Bayesian statistical inference, is considered and shown to be flawed. Two different arguments are presented that demonstrate the irrelevance of SS to replicability: (a) SS may not be taken as a sign of the truth of the research hypothesis; and (b) statistical significance tests do not generate verifiable predictions of replication attempts. Direct tests of replicability and effect-size measures of replicability are shown to have comparable problems. A solution to the replicability problem is proposed for atheoretical research that replaces {`}once-and-for-all{'} tests of replicability with the requirement that the treatment effect be demonstrable (a) in the individual (b) on a continuing basis, and (c) in a way that is clearly discernible. The question of the role of significance testing in research is answered by denying a role to such testing.},

I dispute this by pointing out that the Type II error rate may be as high as 1 - alpha. Falk (1998) defends Bayesian inference, which was impugned by me. She also makes a case for the use of replications for the purpose of testing hypotheses. I complain that the supporters of Bayesian inference have not explained adequately what its purpose or role in science is, and for this reason it is an impediment to understanding in this area. I also dispute Falk{'}s view of the role of replications in that I would require a successful replication to be one that produces an effect that is clearly discernible, meaning the effect is consistently noticeable with the aid of nothing more than descriptive statistics.},

	Abstract = {Statistical power analysis can be used to increase the efficiency of research efforts and to clarify research results, Power analysis is most valuable in the design or planning phases of research efforts. Such prospective (a priori) power analyses can be used to guide research design and to estimate the number of samples necessary to achieve a high probability of detecting biologically significant effects. Retrospective (a posteriori) power analysis has been advocated as a method to increase information about hypothesis tests that were not rejected. However, estimating power for tests of null hypotheses that were not rejected with the effect size observed in the study is incorrect; these power estimates will always be less than or equal to 0.50 when bias adjusted and have no relation to true power. Therefore, retrospective power estimates based on the observed effect size for hypothesis tests that were not rejected are misleading; retrospective power estimates are only meaningful when based on effect sizes other than the observed effect size, such as those effect sizes hypothesized to be biologically significant. Retrospectively power analysis can be used effectively to estimate the number of samples or effect size that would have been necessary for a completed study to have rejected a specific null hypothesis. Simply presenting confidence intervals can provide additional information about null hypotheses that were not rejected, including information about the size of the true effect and whether or not there is adequate evidence to {`}{'}accept{''} a null hypothesis as true, We suggest that (1) statistical power analyses be routinely incorporated into research planning efforts to increase their efficiency; (2) confidence intervals be used in lieu of retrospective power analyses for null hypotheses that were not rejected to assess the likely size of the true effect, (3) minimum biologically significant effect sizes be used for all power analyses, and (4) if retrospective power estimates are to be reported, then the alpha-level, effect sizes, and sample sizes used in calculations must also be reported.},

	Abstract = {1. A major paradigm shift is occurring in the approach of ecologists to statistical analysis. The use of the traditional approach of null-hypothesis testing has been questioned and an alternative, model selection by information-theoretic methods, has been strongly promoted and is now widely used. For certain types of analysis, information-theoretic approaches offer powerful and compelling advantages over null-hypothesis testing. 2. The benefits of information-theoretic methods are often framed as criticisms of null-hypothesis testing. We argue that many of these criticisms are neither irremediable nor always fair. Many are criticisms of the paradigm{'}s application, rather than of its formulation. Information-theoretic methods are equally vulnerable to many such misuses. Care must be taken in the use of either approach but users of null-hypothesis tests, in particular, must greatly improve standards of reporting and interpretation. 3. Recent critiques have suggested that the distinction between experimental and observational studies defines the limits of the utility of null-hypothesis testing (with the paradigm being applicable to the former but not the latter). However, we believe that there are many situations in which observational data are collected that lend themselves to analysis under the null-hypothesis testing paradigm. We suggest that the applicability of the two analytical paradigms is more accurately defined by studies that assess univariate causality (when null-hypothesis testing is adequate) and those that assess multivariate patterns of causality (when information-theoretic methods are more suitable). 4. Synthesis and applications. Many ecologists are confused about the circumstances under which different inferential paradigms might apply. We address some of the major criticisms of the null-hypothesis testing paradigm, assess those criticisms in relation to the information-theoretic paradigm, propose methods for improving the use of null-hypothesis testing, and discuss situations in which the use of null-hypothesis testing would be appropriate. We urge instructors and practitioners of statistical methods to heighten awareness of the limitations of null-hypothesis testing and to use information-theoretic methods whenever prior evidence suggests that multiple research hypotheses are plausible. We contend, however, that by marginalizing the use of null-hypothesis testing, ecologists risk rejecting a powerful, informative and well-established analytical tool.},

@Article{Swift2010,
	Abstract = {A major conservation concern is whether population size and other ecological variables change linearly with habitat loss, or whether they suddenly decline more rapidly below a {``}critical threshold{''} level of habitat. The most commonly discussed explanation for critical threshold responses to habitat loss focus on habitat configuration. As habitat loss progresses, the remaining habitat is increasingly fragmented or the fragments are increasingly isolated, which may compound the effects of habitat loss. In this review we also explore other possible explanations for apparently nonlinear relationships between habitat loss and ecological responses, including Allee effects and time lags, and point out that some ecological variables will inherently respond nonlinearly to habitat loss even in the absence of compounding factors. In the literature, both linear and nonlinear ecological responses to habitat loss are evident among simulation and empirical studies, although the presence and value of critical thresholds is influenced by characteristics of the species (e. g. dispersal, reproduction, area/edge sensitivity) and landscape (e. g. fragmentation, matrix quality, rate of change). With enough empirical support, such trends could be useful for making important predictions about species{'} responses to habitat loss, to guide future research on the underlying causes of critical thresholds, and to make better informed management decisions. Some have seen critical thresholds as a means of identifying conservation targets for habitat retention. We argue that in many cases this may be misguided, and that the meaning (and utility) of a critical threshold must be interpreted carefully and in relation to the response variable and management goal. Despite recent interest in critical threshold responses to habitat loss, most studies have not used any formal statistical methods to identify their presence or value. Methods that have been used include model comparisons using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or t-tests, and significance testing for changes in slope or for polynomial effects. The judicious use of statistics to help determine the shape of ecological relationships would permit greater objectivity and more comparability among studies.},

The rule explains the quantitative photon-energy dependence of the N-band position and its presence or absence in all of the data compiled from the present work and other published works, within the framework of two-photon cross-correlated absorption of the excitation and probe pulses as well as pulse dispersion considered separately in the optics and in the sample.

	Abstract = {Experimental tests of management policy options are becoming popular to resolve uncertainties arising from ecological processes and interactions that cannot be investigated except at held management scales. Such experiments are generally quite costly, time consuming, and sometimes risky We need objective measures of these costs and risks to justify sensible experiments and to compare design alternatives that differ widely in cost and effectiveness. One possible measure of design performance is the expected net present value from the system, averaged over alternative hypotheses about response to experimental treatment. This present value can be estimated by dividing the future stream of expected net benefits into 2 components: short run values obtained during the experiment, and long run values obtained afterward. Experiments that are costly in the short run can be highly worthwhile for the long term if they substantially reduce the odds of using incorrect policies or of overlooking opportunities for increasing value through innovative policy choices, and if the results can be applied to many locations. Optimum experiments in terms of the expected value performance measure are not likely to have as much statistical power as scientists usually demand for traditional hypothesis testing, except in situations where the costs of incorrectly adopting a new management option are high relative to benefits obtained under that option.},

	Abstract = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year{'}s data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

In particular, environmental problems often benefit from the application of Bayesian and decision-theoretic techniques that address the uncertain nature of problems in the environmental and ecological sciences. This paper discusses aspects of implementing statistical decision-making tools in situations where uncertainty is present, looking at issues such as elicitation of prior distributions, covariate allocation, formulation of loss functions, and minimization of expected losses subject to cooperation constraints. These ideas are illustrated through two case studies in environmental remediation.},
