  Abstract                 = {Criticisms of null-hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) are reviewed. Used as formal, two-valued decision procedures, they often generate misleading conclusions. However, critics who argue that NHSTs are totally meaningless because the null hypothesis is virtually always false are overstating their case. Critics also neglect the whole class of valuable significance tests that assess goodness of fit of models to data. Even as applied to simple mean differences, NHSTs can be rhetorically useful in defending research against criticisms that random factors adequately explain the results, or that the direction of mean difference was not demonstrated convincingly. Principled argument and counterargument produce the lore, or communal understanding, in a field, which in turn helps guide new research. Alternative procedures-confidence intervals, effect sizes, and meta-analysis-are discussed. Although these alternatives are not totally free from criticism either, they deserve more frequent use, without an unwise ban on NHSTs.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple model of ratio-dependent predation is developed, and four empirically testable predictions of this model are developed and discussed. One of these predictions is that the predator{'}s death rate and efficiency should not affect the density or dynamics of the prey. This contradicts a wide variety of empirical knowledge. Two types of extension of the simple model are considered. The first is the introduction of handling time, and the other is the introduction of additional prey species. It is shown that previous representations of both of these extensions are inconsistent with the only mechanism that has been shown to generate a ratio-dependent response. Neither of the extensions changes the main anomalous prediction of ratio-dependent models; i.e., that changing the predator{'}s death rate or other components of its fitness will not affect equilibrium prey density.},

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been claimed that the functional response of predators depends on the numbers of prey and predators only via their ratio. Contrary to this claim, I argue that such {`}{'}ratio-dependent{''} functional responses are very unlikely to occur on theoretical grounds and have not been shown empirically. Previous justifications for ratio-dependent functional responses ignore the role of these responses in determining prey population dynamics. Patterns in the abundances of trophic levels and experimental results that have been cited as support for {`}{'}ratio-dependent{''} predation are consistent with numerous other explanations. These other explanations do not suffer from the pathological behaviors and lack of a plausible mechanism that afflict ratio-dependent models. Furthermore, ratio-dependent functional responses, because of their lack of a mechanistic basis, do not provide a good basis for developing more detailed models. Nor can the use of ratio-dependent models be justified as a limiting case of more general predator-dependent models.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores models of four-species food chains in which two species adaptively balance food intake and risk of predation. The purpose is to determine how the interaction of adaptive foraging behaviors in two or more species influences the interactions in the entire food chain. It is shown first that such interacting behaviors will often reach a stable equilibrium. Differential equations are then derived to describe population dynamics when the behaviors remain close to their optima. These equations are very different from Lotka-Volterra-type food web models. The per capita growth rate of each species is affected by the density of every other species in the food chain, and the largest effects may be caused by the species that are most distant in the food chain. Increased predator density may increase the fitness of their prey, while increased prey density may decrease the fitness of their predator. Such unusual interactions are most likely when the adaptive species increase foraging effort in response to increased food availability. The nature of the indirect effects can often be deduced from knowing the sign of the second derivative of foraging cost-and-benefit functions.},

  Abstract                 = {To describe a predator-prey relationship, it is necessary to specify the rate of prey consumption by an average predator. This functional response largely determines dynamic stability, responses to environmental influences and the nature of indirect effects in the food web containing the predator-prey pair. Nevertheless, measurements of functional responses in nature are quite rare. Recently, much work has been devoted to comparing two idealized forms of the functional response: prey dependent and ratio dependent. Although we agree that predator abundance often affects the consumption rate of individual predators, this phenomenon requires more attention. Disagreement remains over which of the two idealized responses serves as a better starting point in building models when data on predator dependence are absent.},

  Abstract                 = {In many predator-prey systems, prey individuals make transitions between vulnerable and invulnerable states or locations. The invulnerable (or less vulnerable) class can be individuals occupying a spatial refuge or those engaged in activities that greatly reduce the risk of predation. Simple models are used to show that transitions between such classes have the following consequences: (1) equilibrium prey density increases as the conditions of prey growth are improved and (2) enrichment often cannot destabilize systems with stable equilibrium densities and may stabilize systems that are undergoing limit cycle oscillations. Transitions to and from invulnerable states therefore represent a possible explanation for the lack of examples of destabilization via fertilization ({''}the paradox of enrichment{''}) in nature. Other theoretical reasons for the apparent absence of the paradox of enrichment are reviewed, and methods of distinguishing the different mechanisms are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian Computing Using R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace{'}s method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples. The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner{'}s g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package.},

The Pipridae is a diverse and well-known family of frugivorous birds that are easily sampled and that are broadly distributed across many Neotropical environments, and as such are appropriate for studies of ecological niche evolution. Using known occurrences and climate and topography data sets, we modeled ecological niches for each species in the family, and carried out analyses aimed at describing ecological niches of manakins and understanding historical patterns of ecological change in the family. Most species{'} ecological niches were characterized by warm and relatively humid conditions, reflecting the great diversification of the family in lowland and montane forests of western South America. Ecological niche evolution was in general conservative, with most sister species pairs being closely similar ecologically, indicating that isolation rather than adaptation to new ecological conditions has dominated the diversification in this family. Exceptions to this pattern represent interesting foci for future research, whereas studies of ecological niches focusing on past distributions of manakins will allow further biogeographic inferences. },

  Abstract                 = {Assessing the nature and magnitude of potential effects of climate change on populations is important to anticipating effects on species diversity for conservation planning. We used ecological niche modeling to predict present and future distributions of 49 species of manakins (Pipridae) and allies. Predictions for present-day distributions were highly coincident with independent test data, suggesting good predictive ability. Assuming no dispersal, projections of potential distributions under four scenarios of climate change predicted that 20% of manakin species would likely go extinct from their current ranges, and that distributions would in general be reduced and fragmented, regardless of the area of present-day potential distribution or rarity. Predicted changes in potential distributions, spatial configuration of suitable habitats, and geographic position of species ranges were more dramatic for species inhabiting flatlands than for montane species. These results are an example of how ecological niche modeling techniques can anticipate the nature and magnitude of changes in biodiversity in response to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a review and critique of statistical null hypothesis testing in ecological studies in general, and wildlife studies in particular, and describes an alternative. Our review of Ecology and the journal of Wildlife Management found the use of null hypothesis testing to be pervasive. The estimated number of P-values appearing within articles of Ecology exceeded 8,000 in 1991 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1984, whereas the estimated number of P-values in the Journal of Wildlife Management exceeded 8,000 in 1997 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1991. We estimated that 47% (SE = 3.9%) of the P-values in the Journal of Wildlife;fe Management lacked estimates of means or effect sizes or even the sign of the difference in means or other parameters. We find that null hypothesis testing is uninformative when no estimates of means or effect size and their precision are given. Contrary to common dogma, tests of statistical null hypotheses have relatively little utility in science and are not a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. We recommend their use be reduced in favor of more informative approaches. Towards this objective, we describe a relatively new paradigm of data analysis based on Kullback-Leibler information. This paradigm is an extension of likelihood theory and, when used correctly, avoids many of the fundamental limitations and common misuses of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic methods focus on providing a strength of evidence for an a priori set of alternative hypotheses, rather than a statistical test of a null hypothesis. This paradigm allows the following types of evidence for the alternative hypotheses: the rank of each hypothesis, expressed as a model; an estimate of the formal likelihood of each model, given the data; a measure of precision that incorporates model selection uncertainty; and simple methods to allow the use of the set of alternative models in making formal inference. We provide an example of the information-theoretic approach using data on the effect of lead on survival in spectacled elder ducks (Somateria fischeri). Regardless of the analysis paradigm used, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be clearly separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging.},

To determine regions of suitable environmental conditions and assess biogeographical questions regarding their ranges, we modelled the potential geographical distributions of two spiny pocket mice (Rodentia: Heteromyidae) in northwestern South America. Location North-western South America. Methods We used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), environmental data from GIS maps and georeferenced collection localities from a recent systematic review of Heteromys australis and H. anomalus to produce the models. Results GARP models indicate the potential presence of H. australis throughout mesic montane regions of north-western South America, as well as in some lowland regions of moderately high precipitation. In contrast, H. anomalus is predicted to occur primarily in drier areas of the Caribbean coast and rain-shadowed valleys of the Andes. Conclusions The models support the disjunct status of the population of H. australis in the Cordillera de Merida, but predict a continuous distribution between known populations of H. anomalus in the upper Magdalena Valley and the Caribbean coast. Regions of suitable environmental conditions exist disjunct from known distributional areas for both species, suggesting possible historical restrictions to their ranges. This technique holds wide application to other study systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) is one of several current approaches to modeling species{'} distributions using occurrence records and environmental data. Because of stochastic elements in the algorithm and underdetermination of the system (multiple solutions with the same value for the optimization criterion), no unique solution is produced. Furthermore, current implementations of GARP utilize only presence data-rather than both presence and absence, the more general case. Hence, variability among GARP models, which is typical of genetic algorithms, and complications in interpreting results based on asymmetrical (presence-only) input data make model selection critical. Generally, some locality records are randomly selected to build a distributional model, with others set aside to evaluate it. Here, we use intrinsic and extrinsic measures of model performance to determine whether optimal models can be identified based on objective intrinsic criteria, without resorting to an independent test data set. We modeled potential distributions of two rodents (Heteromys anomalus and Microryzomys minutus) and one passerine bird (Carpodacus mexicanus), creating 20 models for each species. For each model, we calculated intrinsic and extrinsic measures of omission and commission error, as well as composite indices of overall error. Although intrinsic and extrinsic composite measures of overall model performance were sometimes loosely related to each other, none was consistently associated with expert-judged model quality. In contrast, intrinsic and extrinsic measures were highly correlated for both omission and commission in the two widespread species (H. anomalus and C mexicanus). Furthermore, a clear inverse relationship existed between omission and commission there, and the best models were consistently found at low levels of omission and moderate-to-high commission values. In contrast, all models for M. minutus showed low values of both omission and commission. Because models are based only on presence data (and not all areas are adequately sampled), the corm-nission index reflects not only true commission error but also a component that results from undersampled areas that the species actually inhabits. We here propose an operational procedure for determining an optimal region of the omission/commission relationship and thus selecting high-quality GARP models. Our implementation of this technique for H. anomalus gave a much more reasonable estimation of the species{'} potential distribution than did the original suite of models. These findings are relevant to evaluation of other distributional-modeling techniques based on presence-only data and should also be considered with other machine-learning applications modified for use with asymmetrical input data.

  Abstract                 = {Geographic studies addressing the role of competition in determining species{'} macrodistributions have been limited by only simple or subjective means of identifying regions of suitable habitat. Now, ecological-niche models of species{'} potential distributions present a possible approach to testing for the geographic patterns predicted under competitive exclusion and competitive release. Previously, we modeled the potential distributions of two spiny pocket mice (Heteromys australis and H. anomalus) in northwestern South America using specimen localities, environmental data, and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). Here we superimpose the models to examine known distributional records in areas of potential sympatry between the two species, thus testing the geographic predictions of competitive exclusion. In addition, we examine environmental characteristics of known localities, testing for data consistent with competitive release. Areas of potential sympatry are minimal, lying in regions of intermediate water balance. Only records of H. australis are known from areas of potential sympatry in regions where the species{'} ranges meet, consistent with exclusion of H. anomalus by H. australis. Heteromys anomalus inhabits areas ecologically suitable for both species only in the isolated Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in which H. australis is not present (most likely for historical reasons). Furthermore, environmental characteristics of localities of H. anomalus in biogeographic regions where H. australis is absent fit the pattern predicted under competitive release. In contrast, localities of H. australis show no indication of competitive release. Although the results of present analyses do not conclusively demonstrate competitive exclusion or release, they provide directional hypotheses that can now be tested in experimental field and laboratory studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid anthropogenic climate change is already affecting species distributions and ecosystem functioning worldwide. We applied niche-based models to analyse the impact of climate change on tree species and functional diversity in Europe. Present-day climate was used to predict the distributions of 122 tree species from different functional types (FT). We then explored projections of future distributions under one climate scenario for 2080, considering two alternative dispersal assumptions: no dispersal and unlimited dispersal. The species-rich broadleaved deciduous group appeared to play a key role in the future of different European regions. Temperate areas were projected to lose both species richness and functional diversity due to the loss of broadleaved deciduous trees. These were projected to migrate to boreal forests, thereby increasing their species richness and functional diversity. Atlantic areas provided an intermediate case, with a predicted reduction in the numbers of species and occasional predicted gains in functional diversity. This resulted from a loss in species within the broadleaved deciduous FT, but overall maintenance of the group. Our results illustrate the fact that both species-specific predictions and functional patterns should be examined separately in order to assess the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and gain insights into future ecosystem functioning.},

De plus, un peu d{'}intimit{\'{e}} avec les s{\'{e}}ries montre qu{'}on peut s{'}appuyer sur des graphiques vari{\'{e}}s pour en comprendre assez rapidement la structure, avant toute mod{\'{e}}lisation. Ainsi, au lieu d{'}{\'{e}}tudier des m{\'{e}}thodes de mod{\'{e}}lisation, puis de les illustrer, l{'}auteur prend ici le parti de s{'}int{\'{e}}resser {\`{a}} un nombre limit{\'{e}} de s{\'{e}}ries afin de trouver ce qu{'}on peut dire de chacune. Avant d{'}aborder ces {\'{e}}tudes de cas, il proc{\'{e}}de {\`{a}} quelques rappels et commence par pr{\'{e}}senter les graphiques pour s{\'{e}}ries temporelles offerts par R. Il revient ensuite sur des notions fondamentales de statistique math{\'{e}}matique, puis r{\'{e}}vise les concepts et les mod{\`{e}}les classiques de s{\'{e}}ries.

  Abstract                 = {Dengue fever (DF) is endemic in Medellin, the second largest Colombian city, and surrounding municipalities. We used DF case and satellite environmental data to investigate conditions associated with suitable areas for DF occurrence in 2008 in three municipalities (Bello, Medellin and Itagui). We develop spatially stratified tests of ecological niche models, and found generally good predictive ability, with all model tests yielding results significantly better than random expectations. We concluded that Bello and Medellin present ecological conditions somewhat different from, and more suitable for DF than, those of Itagui. We suggest that areas predicted by our models as suitable for DF could be considered as at-risk, and could be used to guide campaigns for DF prevention in these municipalities. },

High spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery was used for data input. The logistic regression model related presence/absence field data for large woody debris and the Populus spp. to the continuous measurement scale output from matched filter image analysis. The agreement between the image analysis and field data was excellent, as measured by Model chi(2). residual deviance, and Hosmer and Lemeshow{'}s goodness of fit for the logistic regression. Kappa analysis for all possible thresholds imposed on the image output, and receiver operating characteristic curves, also indicated excellent goodness of fit for the image analysis output. The potential for use of logistic regression for both validation of hyperspectral image classification and calibration of results is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecitic competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.

  Abstract                 = {Recent population declines of seed-eating farmland birds have been associated with reduced overwinter survival due to reductions in food supply. An important component of predicting how food shortages will affect animal populations is to measure the functional response, i.e. the relationship between food density and feeding rate, over the range of environmental conditions experienced by foraging animals. Crop stubble fields are an important foraging habitat for many species of seed-eating farmland bird. However, some important questions remain regarding farmland bird foraging behaviour in this habitat, and in particular the effect of stubble on farmland bird functional responses is unknown. We measured the functional responses of a seed-eating passerine, the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, consuming seeds placed on the substrate surface in three different treatments: bare soil, low density stubble and high density stubble. Stubble presence significantly reduced feeding rates, but there was no significant difference between the two stubble treatments. Stubble reduced feeding rates by reducing the maximum attack distance, i.e. the distance over which an individual food item is targeted and consumed. The searching speed, handling time per seed, proportion of time spent vigilant, duration of vigilance bouts and duration of head-down search periods were unaffected by the presence of stubble. The frequency of vigilance bouts was higher in the bare soil treatment, but this is likely to be a consequence of the increased feeding rate. We show the influence of a key habitat type on the functional response of a seed-eating passerine, and discuss the consequences of this for farmland bird conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Routine vigilance is an important component of foraging for many species and can occupy a large proportion of this time. Vigilance can conflict with some aspects of foraging (i.e. searching) and, consequently, has the potential to reduce feeding rates by interrupting foraging behaviours. However, for animals that handle food in an upright posture vigilance can be compatible with this portion of handling and, therefore, any vigilance during this time will incur minimal time-costs to foraging. 2. Several functional response models that incorporate vigilance have assumed that, (i) vigilance preferentially occurs during compatible portions of a foraging routine where no costs are incurred; and (ii) vigilance can be treated as a single discrete block of time related in frequency to the feeding rate, i.e. one vigilance scan per feeding event. 3. To determine whether these assumption are appropriate we measured the vigilance behaviour of four species of granivorous bird, yellowhammer, tree sparrow, linnet and grey partridge, and assessed the quantity of vigilance compared to compatible handling time, the relationship between scan rate and feeding rate and the distribution of vigilance during compatible and non-compatible portions of foraging. 4. The results show that there was frequently enough compatible handling time to accommodate routine vigilance, yet a high proportion of vigilance occurred during non-compatible components of foraging, thus incurring a time-cost. The frequency of vigilance bouts was higher than the feeding rate for three species and, therefore, routine vigilance was not just a by-product of the feeding rate (i.e. one scan per peck). Frequent head-down searching behaviour was recorded during handling suggesting that searching is still a prominent component of foraging even when prey is superabundant. 5. We have shown that the assumptions of previous functional response models might underestimate the effects of vigilance on feeding rate by overestimating the proportion of compatible handling devoted to vigilance. Future functional response models must account for this distribution of vigilance between compatible and non-compatible behavioural states. We derive an example of such a model; however, more experimental research will be needed before we understand the factors that influence the distribution of vigilance.},

  Abstract                 = {Forest-associated species in fragmented landscapes must traverse potentially inhospitable gaps to move between habitat patches. Although conservation biologists advocate connecting patches with corridors or improving the matrix to make it suitable for movement, little is known about the factors influencing gap-crossing decisions for most species. We investigated gap crossing by the red squirrel (Tarniasciurus hudsonicus) in logged landscapes in southeastern Alaska, where the species avoids microhabitats associated with gaps created by clearcutting. We released individuals across clearcuts and determined the routes they took home with tracking spools and radio telemetry. Of 36 adult red squirrels translocated across six clearcuts, 14 crossed clearcuts to reach home. Squirrels were more likely to cross clearcuts if the detour efficiency (distance to home crossing gap divided by distance of forested detour) was low, indicating an ability to compare distances along alternate routes and travel costs or risks in different habitats. No other landscape metrics, such as gap size or crossing distance, predicted crossing behavior. Red squirrels of low body mass were more likely to cross clearcuts, where the probability of encountering conspecifics is low. Distance predicted route choice for squirrels detouring around clearcuts. Indirect evidence suggests that perceived predation risk, energetic costs, or both are higher in clearcuts. Detour efficiency reportedly influences the gap-crossing decisions of some forest-associated birds, but this is the first demonstration of its role in gap-crossing decisions by a mammal.},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of approaches have been used to reconstruct glacial distributions of species, identify their environmental characteristics, and understand their influence on subsequent population expansions. Traditional methods, however, provide only rough estimates of past distributions, and are often unable to identify the ecological and geographic processes that shaped them. Recently, ecological niche modeling (ENM) methodologies have been applied to these questions in an effort to overcome such limitations. We apply ENM to the European faunal record of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to reconstruct ecological niches and potential ranges for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), and evaluate whether their LGM distributions resulted from tracking the geographic footprint of their ecological niches (niche conservatism) or if ecological niche shifts between the LGM and present might be implicated. Results indicate that the LGM geographic ranges of both species represent distributions characterized by niche conservatism, expressed through geographic contraction of the geographic footprints of their respective ecological niches.

Our ECNM approach employed the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) and used as input a combination of archaeological and geographic data, in conjunction with high-resolution paleoclimatic simulations for this time frame. The archaeological data consist of geographic coordinates of sites dated by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to the LGM and attributed to the Solutrean and Epigravettian technocomplexes. The areas predicted by ECNM consistently outline the northern boundary of human presence at 22,000 - 20,000 cal BP. This boundary is mainly determined by climatic constraints and corresponds well to known southern limits of periglacial environments and permafrost conditions during the LGM. Differences between predicted ecological niches and known ranges of the Solutrean and Epigravettian technocomplexes are interpreted as Solutrean populations being adapted to colder and more humid environments and as reflecting influences of ecological risk on geographic distributions of cultures.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a flexible method for modelling zero inflated count data which are typically found when trying to model and predict species distributions. Zero inflated data are defined as data that has a larger proportion of zeros than expected from pure count (Poisson) data. The standard methodology is to model the data in two steps, first modelling the association between the presence and absence of a species and the available covariates and second, modelling the relationship between abundance and the covariates, conditional on the organism being present. The approach in this paper extends previous work to incorporate the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in the modelling steps. The paper develops the link and variance functions needed for the use of GAM with zero inflated data. It then demonstrates the performance of the models using data on stem counts of Eucalyptus mannifera in a region of South East Australia. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Eastern North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) show a series of range shifts during their breeding season. Using ecological niche modeling, we studied the environmental context of these shifts by identifying the ecological conditions that monarchs use in successive summer months. Monarchs use a consistent ecological regimen through the summer, but these conditions contrast strikingly with those used during the winter. Hence, monarchs exhibit niche-following among sequential breeding generations but niche-switching between the breeding and overwintering stages of their annual cycle. We projected their breeding ecological niche onto monthly future climate scenarios, which indicated northward shifts, particularly at the northern extreme of their summer movements, over the next 50 yrs; if both monarchs and their milkweed host plants cannot track these changing climates, monarchs could lose distributional area during critical breeding months.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographic distributions of many marine species are poorly documented or understood, which is particularly true for marine invertebrates. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) offers a means to address this issue, but to date most studies using ENM have focused on terrestrial taxa. In general, ENM relates environmental information to species{'} occurrence data to estimate the ecological niche of a species, rather than just interpolating a geographic distribution, This process leads to predictions of suitable habitat that generally exceed the range actually inhabited by a single species: such areas of geographic over-prediction (commission) may be inhabited by closely related species, and the model thus offers the inferential power to predict the potential distributions of these species as well. We explored the utility of ENM to investigate potential distributions of chirodropid box-jellyfishes (Cnidaria: Cubozoa), a group of highly toxic invertebrates whose biogeography is poorly understood. We were able to predict reported occurrences of box-jellyfishes throughout the Indo-Pacific from data of closely related species. By doing so, we demonstrate that geographic over-prediction in ENM can be desirable when concerned with predictions beyond current knowledge of species{'} distributions. Several methods are used for ENM; here, we compared the 2 most commonly used methods, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Predictions (GARP) and a maximum entropy approach (Maxent). Our comparison shows that Maxent may be more prone to overfilling, whereas GARP tends to produce broader predictions. Transforming continuous Maxent predictions into binary predictions remedies problems of overfilling, and allows for effective extrapolation into unsampled geographic space. },

  Abstract                 = {Multivariate Generalized Linear Mixed Models Using R presents robust and methodologically sound models for analyzing large and complex data sets, enabling readers to answer increasingly complex research questions. The book applies the principles of modeling to longitudinal data from panel and related studies via the Sabre software package in R. The authors first discuss members of the family of generalized linear models, gradually adding complexity to the modeling framework by incorporating random effects. After reviewing the generalized linear model notation, they illustrate a range of random effects models, including three-level, multivariate, endpoint, event history, and state dependence models. They estimate the multivariate generalized linear mixed models (MGLMMs) using either standard or adaptive Gaussian quadrature. The authors also compare two-level fixed and random effects linear models. The appendices contain additional information on quadrature, model estimation, and endogenous variables, along with SabreR commands and examples. In medical and social science research, MGLMMs help disentangle state dependence from incidental parameters. Focusing on these sophisticated data analysis techniques, this book explains the statistical theory and modeling involved in longitudinal studies. Many examples throughout the text illustrate the analysis of real-world data sets. Exercises, solutions, and other material are available on a supporting website.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Climate change has the potential to have significant impacts on the distribution of species and on the composition of habitats. This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management. Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland. Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled. Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response. Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge about biodiversity remains inadequate because most species living on Earth were still not formally described (the Linnean shortfall) and because geographical distributions of most species are poorly understood and usually contain many gaps (the Wallacean shortfall). In this paper, we developed models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of hypothetical non-described species, based on the range size frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories) and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency distribution of these species should be similar to the range-restricted species, which have been most recently described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability, for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the set-covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131 real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to a system based on currently known species. This main result can be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be defensible.},

The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book{'}s own website. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information systems, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science. The book has a website where coloured figures, complete code examples, data sets, and other support material may be found: http://www.asdar-book.org.},

Thus, we provide a conceptual framework for the design and implementation of monitoring studies to understand the effects of restoration on wildlife. Our underlying premise is that effective monitoring hinges on an appropriate study design for unbiased and precise estimates of the response variables. We advocate using measures of population dynamics for response variables given that they provide the most direct measures of wildlife status and trends. The species to be monitored should be those constituting an assemblage of umbrella species that represent the range of spatial and functional requirements of wildlife in a restored ecological system. Selection of umbrella species should be based on strong empirical evidence that justifies their usage. We also advocate that monitoring be designed as true experiments or quasi-experiments rather than as observational studies to allow for stronger inferences regarding the effects of restoration on wildlife. Our primary message is that if monitoring is to be done, it must be scientifically based.},

  Abstract                 = {The establishment of ecological networks (ENs) has been proposed as an ideal way to counteract the increasing fragmentation of natural ecosystems and as a necessary complement to the establishment of protected areas for biodiversity conservation. This conservation tool, which comprises core areas, corridors, and buffer areas, has attracted the attention of several national and European institutions. It is thought that ENs can connect habitat patches and thus enable species to move across unsuitable areas. In Europe, however, ENs are proposed as an oversimplification of complex ecological concepts, and we maintain that they are of limited use for biodiversity conservation for several reasons. The ENs are species specific and operate on species-dependent scales. In addition, the information needed for their implementation is only available for a handful of species. To overcome these limitations, ENs have been proposed on a landscape scale (and for selected "focal" species), but there is no indication that the structural composition of core areas, corridors, and buffer areas could ensure the functional connectivity and improve the viability of more than a few species. The theory behind ENs fails to provide sufficient practical information on how to build them (e.g., width, shape, structure, content). In fact, no EN so far has been validated in practice (ensuring connectivity and increasing overall biodiversity conservation), and there are no signs that validation will be possible in the near future. In view of these limitations, it is difficult to justify spending economic and political resources on building systems that are at best working hypotheses that cannot be evaluated on a practical level.},

Our argument combines knowledge of tree recovery from injury after grassland fires, with theory about carbon acquisition and carbohydrate storage patterns in C3 woody plants in response to elevated CO2. We propose simply that elevated CO2 will tend to favour regrowth of juvenile trees trapped (sometimes for decades) in the {'}topkill{'} zone, thus allowing them to escape more readily from periodic fires as CO2 continues to rise. Little empirical evidence exists to test this hypothesis, even though the process may have important implications for tree/grass codominated ecosystems currently in a dynamic equilibrium. },

  Abstract                 = {The distribution and abundance of trees can be strongly affected by disturbance such as fire. In mixed tree/grass ecosystems, recurrent grass-fuelled fires can strongly suppress tree saplings and therefore control tree dominance. We propose that changes in atmospheric [CO2] could influence tree cover in such metastable ecosystems by altering their postburn recovery rates relative to flammable herbaceous growth forms such as grasses. Slow sapling recovery rates at low [CO2] would favour the spread of grasses and a reduction of tree cover. To test the possible importance of [CO2]/fire interactions, we first used a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) to simulate biomass in grassy ecosystems in South Africa with and without fire. The results indicate that fire has a major effect under higher rainfall conditions suggesting an important role for fire/[CO2] interactions. We then used a demographic model of the effects of fire on mesic savanna trees to test the importance of grass/tree differences in postburn recovery rates. We adjusted grass and tree growth in the model according to the DGVM output of net primary production at different [CO2] relative to current conditions. The simulations predicted elimination of trees at [CO2] typical of the last glacial period (180 ppm) because tree growth rate is too slow (15 years) to grow to a fire-proof size of ca. 3 m. Simulated grass growth would produce an adequate fuel load for a burn in only 2 years. Simulations of preindustrial [CO2] (270 ppm) predict occurrence of trees but at low densities. The greatest increase in trees occurs from preindustrial to current [CO2] (360 ppm). The simulations are consistent with palaeo-records which indicate that trees disappeared from sites that are currently savannas in South Africa in the last glacial. Savanna trees reappeared in the Holocene. There has also been a large increase in trees over the last 50-100 years. We suggest that slow tree recovery after fire, rather than differential photosynthetic efficiencies in C-3 and C-4 plants, might have been the significant factor in the Late Tertiary spread of flammable grasslands under low [CO2] because open, high light environments would have been a prerequisite for the spread of C-4 grasses. Our simulations suggest further that low [CO2] could have been a significant factor in the reduction of trees during glacial times, because of their slower regrowth after disturbance, with fire favouring the spread of grasses. },

  Abstract                 = {The role of fire in determining biome distribution in South Africa has long been debated. Acocks labelled veld types that he thought were {'}fire climax{'} as {'}false{'}. He hypothesised that their current extent was due to extensive forest clearance by Iron Age farmers. We tested the relative importance of fire and climate in determining ecosystem characteristics by simulating potential vegetation of South Africa with and without fire using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). The simulations suggest that most of the eastern half of the country could support much higher stem biomass without fire and that the vegetation would be dominated by trees instead of grasses. Fynbos regions in mesic winter rainfall areas would also become tree dominated. We collated results of long term fire exclusion studies to further test the relative importance of fire and climate. These show that grassy ecosystems with rainfall \textgreater650mm tend towards fire-sensitive forests with fire excluded. Areas below 650mm showed changes in tree density and size but no trend of changing composition to forest. We discuss recent evidence that C-4 grasslands first appeared between 6 and 8M years BP, long before the appearance of modern humans. However these grassy ecosystems are among the most recently developed biomes on the planet. We briefly discuss the importance of fire in promoting their spread in the late Tertiary. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper is the first global study of the extent to which fire determines global vegetation patterns by preventing ecosystems from achieving the potential height, biomass and dominant functional types expected under the ambient climate (climate potential). To determine climate potential, we simulated vegetation without fire using a dynamic global-vegetation model. Model results were tested against fire exclusion studies from different parts of the world. Simulated dominant growth forms and tree cover were compared with satellite-derived land- and tree-cover maps. Simulations were generally consistent with results of fire exclusion studies in southern Africa and elsewhere. Comparison of global {'}fire off{'} simulations with landcover and treecover maps show that vast areas of humid C-4 grasslands and savannas, especially in South America and Africa, have the climate potential to form forests. These are the most frequently burnt ecosystems in the world. Without fire, closed forests would double from 27% to 56% of vegetated grid cells, mostly at the expense of C-4 plants but also of C-3 shrubs and grasses in cooler climates. C-4 grasses began spreading 6-8 Ma, long before human influence on fire regimes. Our results suggest that fire was a major factor in their spread into forested regions, splitting biotas into fire tolerant and intolerant taxa. },

  Abstract                 = {Several North American broad-leaved tree species range from the northern United States at similar to 47 degrees N to moist tropical montane forests in Mexico and Central America at 15-20 degrees N. Along this gradient the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month (T (Jan)), which characterize annual variation in temperature, increase from -10 to 12 degrees C and tree phenology changes from deciduous to leaf-exchanging or evergreen in the southern range with a year-long growing season. Between 30 and 45 degrees N, the time of bud break is highly correlated with T (Jan) and bud break can be reliably predicted for the week in which mean minimum temperature rises to 7 degrees C. Temperature-dependent deciduous phenology-and hence the validity of temperature-driven phenology models-terminates in southern North America near 30 degrees N, where T (Jan)\textgreater 7 degrees C enables growth of tropical trees and cultivation of frost-sensitive citrus fruits. In tropical climates most temperate broad-leaved species exchange old for new leaves within a few weeks in January-February, i.e., their phenology becomes similar to that of tropical leaf-exchanging species. Leaf buds of the southern ecotypes of these temperate species are therefore not winter-dormant and have no chilling requirement. As in many tropical trees, bud break of Celtis, Quercus and Fagus growing in warm climates is induced in early spring by increasing daylength. In tropical climates vegetative phenology is determined mainly by leaf longevity, seasonal variation in water stress and day length. As water stress during the dry season varies widely with soil water storage, climate-driven models cannot predict tree phenology in the tropics and tropical tree phenology does not constitute a useful indicator of global warming. },

  Abstract                 = {Animal group size distributions are often right-skewed, whereby most groups are small, but most individuals occur in larger groups that may also disproportionately affect ecology and policy. In this case, examining covariates associated with upper quantiles of the group size distribution could facilitate better understanding and management of large animal groups. We studied wintering elk groups in Wyoming, where group sizes span several orders of magnitude, and issues of disease, predation and property damage are affected by larger group sizes. We used quantile regression to evaluate relationships between the group size distribution and variables of land use, habitat, elk density and wolf abundance to identify conditions important to larger groups. We recorded 1263 groups ranging from 1 to 1952 elk, and found that across all quantiles of group size, group sizes were larger in open habitat and on private land (than on public land), and that the largest effect occurred between irrigated and non-irrigated land (e.g. the 90th quantile group size increased by 135 elk [95% CI = 42, 227] on irrigation). Only upper quantile group sizes were positively related to broad scale elk density and wolf abundance, and for wolf abundance this effect was greater on groups found in open habitats and private land than those in closed habitats or public land. If we had limited our analysis to mean or median group sizes, we would not have detected these effects. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis of elk group size distributions using quantile regression suggests that private land, irrigation, open habitat, elk density and wolf abundance can affect large elk group sizes. Thus, to manage larger groups by removal or dispersal of individuals we recommend incentivizing hunting on private land during the regular and late hunting seasons, promoting tolerance of wolves on private land (if elk aggregate in these areas to avoid wolves), and creating more winter range and varied habitats. Relationships to the variables of interest also differed by quantile, highlighting the importance of using quantile regression to examine response variables more completely to uncover relationships important to conservation and management.

This climate matching approach relies on the assumption that invasive species conserve their climatic niche in the invaded ranges. We test this assumption by analysing the climatic niche spaces of Spotted Knapweed in western North America and Europe. We show with robust cross-continental data that a shift of the observed climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing the first empirical evidence that an invasive species can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into a new area. The models fail to predict the current invaded distribution, but correctly predict areas of introduction. Climate matching is thus a useful approach to identify areas at risk of introduction and establishment of newly or not-yet-introduced neophytes, but may not predict the full extent of invasions.},

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of {``}close fit{''} of a model is suggested.},

The first is a Poisson regression of bird counts in which a choice is to be made between inclusion of one or both of two covariates. The second is a line transect data set for which different models yield substantially different estimates of abundance. The third is a simulated example in which truth is known.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an information-theoretic paradigm for analysis of ecological data, based on Kullback-Leibler information, that is an extension of likelihood theory and avoids the pitfalls of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the a priori science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model (g(i)), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. L(g(i)\textbackslashdata)). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference can be based on all the models in the a priori set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals (Mirounga leonina).},

  Abstract                 = {1. Type II functional responses, which can be described by Holling{'}s disc equation, have been found in many studies of predator/prey and host/parasite interactions. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that the assumptions on which the disc equation is based do not necessarily hold. We examine the functional response of kleptoparasitically feeding Arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus L.) to the abundance of fish-carrying auks and, by examination of the assumptions of the disc equation, test whether it can explain the function. 2. The rate at which individual skuas make successful chases is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. However, it would appear that this is not determined by factors that influence their probability of success, but by the rate at which they initiate chases. This too is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks, Arctic skuas have a Type II functional response. 3. Although Arctic skuas exhibited a direct numerical response there was no evidence that components of predation connected to the density of predators (direct prey stealing, or increased host avoidance) had any effect on the rate at which individual skuas made chases or were successful in their chases, We conclude that the observed functional response is free from any effects of interference. 4. We suggest that abnormally high levels of foraging effort expended by breeding skuas and their poor breeding success in the years of observation argue against the limit to the observed functional response being determined by skuas{'} energetic requirements 5. Several of the assumptions underlying the disc equation do not hold. The duration of chases (handling time) was not a constant; it decreased with increasing host abundance, Moreover, the chase duration predicted by the disc equation, if handling time limited the functional response, was far in excess of that observed. Furthermore, the observed rate of decline in the searching time per victim with increasing host abundance suggested that skuas{'} instantaneous rate of discovery was also not constant. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed. The basic disc equation may describe Arctic skuas{'} functional response, but it cannot explain it.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Interference between foraging animals can be quantified directly only through intensive studies. A quicker alternative is to predict the strength of interference using behaviour-based models. We describe a field method to parameterize an interference model for shorebirds, Charadrii. 2. Kleptoparasitic attack distance is the main factor affecting the strength of interference but has rarely been measured. Attack distance is related to handling time, a frequently measured parameter, allowing the model to be parameterized for systems in which attack distance has not been measured. 3. The model accurately predicts the strength of interference between oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus L. feeding on cockles Cerastoderma edule L. and the absence of interference between bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica L. feeding on lugworms Arenicola marina L. at low competitor densities. 4. We predict the strength of interference in black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa L. and oystercatcher systems in which it has not been measured previously. The strength of interference is almost entirely determined by attack distance; interference is stronger in systems with longer attacks. Interference is usually weaker in black-tailed godwits because handling time is generally shorter and this limits attack distance. 5. The interference model can be parameterized much more quickly than the alternative of measuring interference directly. Behaviour-based models have the potential to be a valuable tool for predicting the strength of interference.},

  Abstract                 = {Fits of nonlinear difference equations to time series with observation errors were examined by stochastic simulation and analysis of plankton time series from two lakes. Even modest observation errors (e.g., coefficient of variation among replicate samples approximate to 10%) cause errors in model identification and bias in parameter estimates. The latter problem can be corrected by estimation techniques that account for observation error, but model identification is difficult unless the state variables are manipulated. Without manipulation, statistical criteria tend to favor linear models, even when data are simulated by nonlinear processes. Methods that account for observation error produced satisfactory fits to time series of edible algae from two lakes over 7 yr. In Paul Lake, which has not been manipulated, the best fitting model included linear growth, a linear functional response for grazing loss, and an autoregressive moving average model for the errors. In manipulated Tuesday Lake, the best fitting model included linear growth and a nonlinear functional response. Experimental manipulations, or other substantial perturbations, may be essential for detection of nonlinearities in ecological interactions.},

First, they can insert statistically in front of significant in research reports. Second, results can be interpreted before p values are reported. Third, effect sizes can be reported along with measures of sampling error. Fourth, replication can be built into the design. The touting of insignificant results as significant because they are statistically significant is not likely to change until researchers break the stranglehold that statistical significance testing has on journal editors.},

  Abstract                 = {Conservation evaluation of large areas (\textgreater 10 000 km(2)) in Australia requires detailed mapping of vegetation types. Predicting the original vegetation cover of extensive cleared areas in an explicit, consistent and repeatable manner necessitates the use of statistical modelling. This paper describes an integrated approach to vegetation mapping in a region of New South Wales, Australia. The approach uses separate statistical models for each tree and shrub species to predict the vegetation composition in each grid cell in a geographic information system (GIS). Allocation of these grid cells to communities allows communities that no longer exist in the remaining remnants of woodland to be defined. Examples of use of this information for management are presented. This paper addresses the practical considerations which constrain the way statistical modelling can be used for vegetation mapping in an applied project. Constraints include: (1) data availability (use of sampling to fill gaps in existing data), (2) the effects of cover abundance values, (3) availability of GIS predictors, (4) data management, (5) current generalised additive model methods and (6) prediction methods. Careful attention to the practicality of all components of a vegetation mapping study is essential if modern methods are to be applied in regional studies which must provide functional products for land managers with limited resources, skills and finances at their disposal.},

  Abstract                 = {A central goal of behavioral ecology is to quantify and explain variation in behavior. While much previous work has focused on the differences in mean behavior across groups or treatments, we present a complementary approach studying changes in the distribution of the response variable. This is important because changes in the edges of a distribution may be more informative than changes in the mean if behavior at the edges of a distribution better reflects behavioral constraints. Quantile regression estimates the rate of change of conditional quantiles of a response variable and thus allows the study of changes in any part of its distribution. Although quantile regression is gaining popularity in the ecological literature, it is strikingly unused in behavioral ecology. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method by analyzing the relationship between the starting distance (SD) at which an observer approach a focal animal and its flight initiation distance (FID, the distance between the observer and the animal when it decides to flee). In particular, we used a simple model of flight initiation distance to show that in most situations ordinary least-square regression cannot be used to analyse the SD{--}FID relationship. Quantile regression conducted on the lowest quantiles appears more robust and we applied this approach to data from four bird species. Overall, changes in the lowest FID values appeared to be the most informative to determine if a species displays a {``}flush early{''} strategy, a strategy which has been hypothesized to be a general rule. We hope this example will bring quantile regression to the attention of behavioral ecologists as a valuable tool to add to their statistical toolbox.},

  Abstract                 = {The classic Jaccard and Sorensen indices of compositional similarity (and other indices that depend upon the same variables) are notoriously sensitive to sample size, especially for assemblages with numerous rare species. Further, because these indices are based solely on presence-absence data, accurate estimators for them are unattainable. We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sorensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundance-based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

  Abstract                 = {Importance $$nThe use and misuse of P values has generated extensive debates.Objective$$nTo evaluate in large scale the P values reported in the abstracts and full text of biomedical research articles over the past 25 years and determine how frequently statistical information is presented in ways other than P values.Design$$nAutomated text-mining analysis was performed to extract data on P values reported in 12*821*790 MEDLINE abstracts and in 843*884 abstracts and full-text articles in PubMed Central (PMC) from 1990 to 2015. Reporting of P values in 151 English-language core clinical journals and specific article types as classified by PubMed also was evaluated. A random sample of 1000 MEDLINE abstracts was manually assessed for reporting of P values and other types of statistical information; of those abstracts reporting empirical data, 100 articles were also assessed in full text.Main Outcomes and Measures$$nP values reported.Results$$nText mining identified 4*572*043 P values in 1*608*736 MEDLINE abstracts and 3*438*299 P values in 385*393 PMC full-text articles. Reporting of P values in abstracts increased from 7.3% in 1990 to 15.6% in 2014. In 2014, P values were reported in 33.0% of abstracts from the 151 core clinical journals (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}29*725 abstracts), 35.7% of meta-analyses (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}5620), 38.9% of clinical trials (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}4624), 54.8% of randomized controlled trials (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}13*544), and 2.4% of reviews (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}71*529). The distribution of reported P values in abstracts and in full text showed strong clustering at P values of .05 and of .001 or smaller. Over time, the {``}best{''} (most statistically significant) reported P values were modestly smaller and the {``}worst{''} (least statistically significant) reported P values became modestly less significant. Among the MEDLINE abstracts and PMC full-text articles with P values, 96% reported at least 1 P value of .05 or lower, with the proportion remaining steady over time in PMC full-text articles. In 1000 abstracts that were manually reviewed, 796 were from articles reporting empirical data; P values were reported in 15.7% (125/796 [95% CI, 13.2%-18.4%]) of abstracts, confidence intervals in 2.3% (18/796 [95% CI, 1.3%-3.6%]), Bayes factors in 0% (0/796 [95% CI, 0%-0.5%]), effect sizes in 13.9% (111/796 [95% CI, 11.6%-16.5%]), other information that could lead to estimation of P values in 12.4% (99/796 [95% CI, 10.2%-14.9%]), and qualitative statements about significance in 18.1% (181/1000 [95% CI, 15.8%-20.6%]); only 1.8% (14/796 [95% CI, 1.0%-2.9%]) of abstracts reported at least 1 effect size and at least 1 confidence interval. Among 99 manually extracted full-text articles with data, 55 reported P values, 4 presented confidence intervals for all reported effect sizes, none used Bayesian methods, 1 used false-discovery rates, 3 used sample size/power calculations, and 5 specified the primary outcome.Conclusions and Relevance$$nIn this analysis of P values reported in MEDLINE abstracts and in PMC articles from 1990-2015, more MEDLINE abstracts and articles reported P values over time, almost all abstracts and articles with P values reported statistically significant results, and, in a subgroup analysis, few articles included confidence intervals, Bayes factors, or effect sizes. Rather than reporting isolated P values, articles should include effect sizes and uncertainty metrics.},

  Abstract                 = { In biostatistical research and courses, practitioners and students often lack a thorough understanding of how to apply statistical methods to synthesize biomedical and clinical trial data. Filling this knowledge gap, Applied Meta-Analysis with R shows how to implement statistical meta-analysis methods to real data using R. Drawing on their extensive research and teaching experiences, the authors provide detailed, step-by-step explanations of the implementation of meta-analysis methods using R. Each chapter gives examples of real studies compiled from the literature. After presenting the data and necessary background for understanding the applications, various methods for analyzing meta-data are introduced. The authors then develop analysis code using the appropriate R packages and functions. This systematic approach helps readers thoroughly understand the analysis methods and R implementation, enabling them to use R and the methods to analyze their own meta-data. Suitable as a graduate-level text for a meta-data analysis course, the book is also a valuable reference for practitioners and biostatisticians (even those with little or no experience in using R) in public health, medical research, governmental agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry.},

  Abstract                 = {Too often in biostatistical research and clinical trials, a knowledge gap exists between developed statistical methods and the applications of these methods. Filling this gap, Clinical Trial Data Analysis Using R provides a thorough presentation of biostatistical analyses of clinical trial data and shows step by step how to implement the statistical methods using R. The book{'}s practical, detailed approach draws on the authors{'} 30 years of real-world experience in biostatistical research and clinical development. Each chapter presents examples of clinical trials based on the authors{'} actual experiences in clinical drug development. Various biostatistical methods for analyzing the data are then identified. The authors develop analysis code step by step using appropriate R packages and functions. This approach enables readers to gain an understanding of the analysis methods and R implementation so that they can use R to analyze their own clinical trial data. With step-by-step illustrations of R implementations, this book shows how to easily use R to simulate and analyze data from a clinical trial. It describes numerous up-to-date statistical methods and offers sound guidance on the processes involved in clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Resampling helps students understand the meaning of sampling distributions, sampling variability, P-values, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals. This book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques. The book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods. Striking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as: Exploratory data analysis, Calculation of sampling distributions, The Central Limit Theorem, Monte Carlo sampling, Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators, Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, Regression, Bayesian methods. Case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the material. Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for applied statisticians working in the areas of business, economics, biostatistics, and public health who utilize resampling methods in their everyday work.},

  Abstract                 = {The null-hypothesis significance-test procedure (NHSTP) is defended in the context of the theory-corroboration experiment, as well as the following contrasts: (a) substantive hypotheses versus statistical hypotheses, (b) theory corroboration versus statistical hypothesis testing, (c) theoretical inference versus statistical decision, (d) experiments versus nonexperimental studies, and (e) theory corroboration versus treatment assessment. The null hypothesis can be true because it is the hypothesis that errors are randomly distributed in data. Moreover, the null hypothesis is never used as a categorical proposition. Statistical significance means only that chance influences can be excluded as an explanation of data; it does not identify the nonchance factor responsible. The experimental conclusion is drawn with the inductive principle underlying the experimental design. A chain of deductive arguments gives rise to the theoretical conclusion via the experimental conclusion. The anomalous relationship between statistical significance and the effect size often used to criticize NHSTP is more apparent than real. The absolute size of the effect is not an index of evidential support for the substantive hypothesis. Nor is the effect size, by itself, informative as to the practical importance of the the research result. Being a conditional probability, statistical power cannot be the a priori probability of statistical significance. The validity of statistical power is debatable because statistical significance is determined with a single sampling distribution of the test statistic based on H-0, whereas it takes two distributions to represent statistical power or effect size. Sample size should not be determined in the mechanical manner envisaged in power analysis. It is inappropriate to criticize NHSTP for nonstatistical reasons. At the same time, neither effect size, nor confidence interval estimate, nor posterior probability can be used to exclude chance as an explanation of data. Neither can any of them fulfill the nonstatistical functions expected of them by critics.},

The present paper reviews the degree to which statistical power has been explicitly considered in papers published in the British Journal of Psychology in 1993 and 1994. It summarizes the power for small, medium and large effect sizes for 54 papers, based on the sample sizes which were employed. The analysis confirms that the power of statistical tests is not taken into account by researchers and that, accordingly, they continue to run a high risk of rejecting their research hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantifying shape and size variation is essential in evolutionary biology and in many other disciplines. Since the {``}morphometric revolution of the 90s,{''} an increasing number of publications in applied and theoretical morphometrics emerged in the new discipline of statistical shape analysis. The R language and environment offers a single platform to perform a multitude of analyses from the acquisition of data to the production of static and interactive graphs. This offers an ideal environment to analyze shape variation and shape change. This open-source language is accessible for novices and for experienced users. Adopting R gives the user and developer several advantages for performing morphometrics: evolvability, adaptability, interactivity, a single and comprehensive platform, possibility of interfacing with other languages and software, custom analyses, and graphs. The book explains how to use R for morphometrics and provides a series of examples of codes and displays covering approaches ranging from traditional morphometrics to modern statistical shape analysis such as the analysis of landmark data, Thin Plate Splines, and Fourier analysis of outlines. The book fills two gaps: the gap between theoreticians and students by providing worked examples from the acquisition of data to analyses and hypothesis testing, and the gap between user and developers by providing and explaining codes for performing all the steps necessary for morphometrics rather than providing a manual for a given software or package. Students and scientists interested in shape analysis can use the book as a reference for performing applied morphometrics, while prospective researchers will learn how to implement algorithms or interfacing R for new methods. In addition, adopting the R philosophy will enhance exchanges within and outside the morphometrics community. Julien Claude is evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist at the University of Montpellier 2 where he got his Ph.D. in 2003. He works on biodiversity and phenotypic evolution of a variety of organisms, especially vertebrates.

Compared to mean comparisons, d is more robust and equally or more powerful; it is invariant under transformation. and it often conforms more closely to the experimenter{'}s research hypothesis. It is suggested that inferences from d be based on sample estimates of its variance rather than on the more traditional assumption of identical distributions. The statistic is extended to simple repeated measures designs, and ways of extending its use to more complex designs are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {While it is a truism that species rarity is non-randomly distributed across regions, habitats, and taxa, there is little consensus on which factors are the best predictors of low abundances and restricted geographical ranges. In this study, we evaluate the effects of ecological and life-history traits, as well as phylogeny, on rarity in the abundance and distribution of land birds inhabiting forest habitats in the Mediterranean and temperate regions of Chile. We use data on abundance collected at 16 sites and data on latitudinal distribution obtained from a literature compilation. Statistical analyses were based on multiple regression and multivariate models. We used Signed Mantel test to analyse the relationship between species ecological and life-history traits and rarity, taking into account the effect of phylogenetic relatedness. We found that rarity, in terms of distribution, is associated with a low investment in reproduction, non-migratory status, and degree of habitat specialization. These ecological and life-history traits, in association with forest loss due to climatic changes and human impacts, may explain the narrow distribution of most endemic forest birds species. Rarity in abundance, on the other hand, is more difficult to explain. However, the fact that large species with an insectivorous diet showed low density in the assemblages studied suggests that abundance is mostly regulated by energy (resource) requirements and availability. Finally, our study shows that there is no phylogenetic influence in the observed patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {After 4 decades of severe criticism, the ritual of null hypothesis significance testing-mechanical dichotomous decisions around a sacred .05 criterion-still persists. This article reviews the problems with this practice, including its near-universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H0 is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H0 one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods is suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Both the magnitude and the urgency of the task of assessing global biodiversity require that we make the most of what we know through the use of estimation and extrapolation. Likewise, future biodiversity inventories need to be designed around the use of effective sampling and estimation procedures, especially for {'}hyperdiverse{'} groups of terrestrial organisms, such as arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms. The challenge of estimating patterns of species richness from samples can be separated into (i) the problem of estimating local species richness, and (ii) the problem of estimating the distinctness, or complementarity, of species assemblages. These concepts apply on a wide range of spatial, temporal, and functional scales. Local richness can be estimated by extrapolating species accumulation curves, fitting parametric distributions of relative abundance, or using non-parametric techniques based on the distribution of individuals among species or of species among samples. We present several of these methods and examine their effectiveness for an example data set. We present a simple measure of complementarity, with some biogeographic examples, and outline the difficult problem of estimating complementarity from samples. Finally, we discuss the importance of using {'}reference{'} sites (or sub-sites) to assess the true richness and composition of species assemblages, to measure ecologically significant ratios between unrelated taxa, to measure taxon/sub-taxon (hierarchical) ratios, and to {'}calibrate{'} standardized sampling methods. This information can then be applied to the rapid, approximate assessment of species richness and faunal or floral composition at {'}comparative{'} sites.},

The role of graphical methods is shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the early exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too, when comparing and evaluating models. All examples are based on freely available software: GGobi for interactive graphics and R for static graphics, modeling, and programming. The printed book is augmented by a wealth of material on the web, encouraging readers follow the examples themselves.

We used this tool to characterize ecologic differentiation of Triatoma brasiliensis populations, the most important Chagas{'} disease vector in northeastern Brazil. The species{'} ecologic niche was modeled based on data from the Fundaca (o) over tilde Nacional de Saude of Brazil (1997-1999) with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). This method involves a machine-learning approach to detecting associations between occurrence points and ecologic characteristics of regions. Four independent "ecologic niche models" were developed and used to test for ecologic differences among T. brasiliensis populations. These models confirmed four ecologically distinct and differentiated populations, and allowed characterization of dimensions of niche differentiation. Patterns of ecologic similarity matched patterns of molecular differentiation, suggesting that T brasiliensis is a complex of distinct populations at various points in the process of speciation.},

  Abstract                 = {This book gives you a step-by-step introduction to analysing time series using the open source software R. Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence confirms understanding of both the model and the R routine for fitting it to the data. Finally, the model is applied to an analysis of a historical data set. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/emac2009/. The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyze time series as part of their taught program or their research.},

Although the emphasis is on time domain ARIMA models and their analysis, the new edition devotes two chapters to the frequency domain and three to time series regression models, models for heteroscedasticty, and threshold models. All of the ideas and methods are illustrated with both real and simulated data sets. A unique feature of this edition is its integration with the R computing environment. The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by the R commands used to produce them. An extensive R package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book, accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are available for download. There is also an extensive appendix in the book that leads the reader through the use of R commands and the new R package to carry out the analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {Chow{'}s defense of NHSTP ignores the fact that in psychology it is used to test substantive hypotheses in theory-corroborating research. In this role, NHSTP is not only inadequate, but damaging to the progress of psychology as a science. NHSTP does not fulfill the Popperian requirement that theories be tested severely. It also encourages nonspecific predictions and feeble theoretical formulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Potted seedlings of Leucadendron xanthoconus (Proteaceae) were grown in native mountain fynbos soil under different nutrient and water regimes. Nutrient treatments comprised addition of nitrogen, phosphorus and a Long Ashton macronutrient solution (LA). Water was applied at three levels, ranging from near drought to maintained saturation. Rates of gas exchange were measured on a subset of the experimental plants under a range of irradiance levels prior to harvesting of all plants at an age of six months. Measurement of biomass and its distribution showed that increasing water had a significantly positive effect on productivity, and that drought reduced root:shoot ratio and leaf specific weight. Total productivity was highest with LA-addition and lowest in the control, whereas phosphorus and nitrogen additions had an intermediate effect. None of the treatments included in the gas exchange work was shown to affect significantly photosynthetic capacity or water use efficiency. Droughted individuals showed an increased ability to reduce carbon dioxide concentration in the substomatal cavity, and a lower stomatal conductance overall. Stomatal conductance was found to be independent of irradiance in all treatments. The relationships investigated are placed in the context of fynbos utilization and the management of natural fynbos landscapes with regard to the reclamation and maintenance of component natural ecosystems. },

Such equating of inverse probabilities implies ignoring base rates. Later, many researchers demonstrated such neglect in a number of experimental contexts involving hypothetical judgments; others have found some use of base rates-but only when base rates were supplied by the experimenter, in which case even irrelevant base rates influenced judgment. The present study tested for equating conditional probabilities in a context similar to the contexts involved in the initial observations-that is, subjects strove for accuracy rather than attempted to make good judgments about hypothetical problems, and the base rates were generated by the subjects themselves. Neglect of base rates was revealed by within-individual comparisons showing subjects equated inverse probabilities without equating the corresponding unconditional ones.},

It covers some mathematical topics such as, graphing the Cobb-Douglas function, using R to study the Solow growth model, in addition to statistical topics, from drawing statistical graphs to doing linear and logistic regression. It uses data that can be downloaded from the internet, and which is also available in different R packages.

The maximum entropy approach was somewhat more conservative in its evaluation Of Suitability, depending on thresholds for presence/absence that are selected, largely excluding areas with distinct dry seasons; the genetic algorithm models, in contrast, indicate that climate class as partly suitable.

  Abstract                 = {Aim To predict and compare potential geographical distributions of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) and Natal fruit fly (Ceratitis rosa). Location Africa, southern Europe, and worldwide. Methods Two correlative ecological niche modelling techniques, genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and a technique based on principal components analysis (PCA), were used to predict distributions of the two fly species using distribution records and a set of environmental predictor variables. Results The two species appear to have broadly similar potential ranges in Africa and southern Europe, with much of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar predicted as highly suitable. The drier regions of Africa (central and western regions of southern Africa and Sahelian zone) were identified as being less suitable for C. rosa than for C. capitata. Overall, the proportion of the region predicted to be highly suitable is larger for C. capitata than for C. rosa under both techniques, suggesting that C. capitata may be tolerant of a wider range of climatic conditions than C. rosa. Worldwide, tropical and subtropical regions are highlighted as highly suitable for both species. Differences in overlap of predictions from the two models for these species were observed. An evaluation using independent records from the adventive range for C. capitata and comparison with other predictions suggest that GARP models offer more accurate predictions than PCA models. Main conclusions This study suggests that these species have broadly similar potential distributions worldwide (based on climate), although the potential distribution appears to be broader for C. capitata than for C. rosa. Ceratitis capitata has become invasive throughout the world, whereas C. rosa has not, despite both species having broadly similar potential distributions. Further research into the biology of these species and their ability to overcome barriers is necessary to explain this difference, and to better understand invasion risk.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.},

  Abstract                 = {R is the amazing, free, open-access software package for scientific graphs and calculations used by scientists worldwide. The R Student Companion is a student-oriented manual describing how to use R in high school and college science and mathematics courses. Written for beginners in scientific computation, the book assumes the reader has just some high school algebra and has no computer programming background. The author presents applications drawn from all sciences and social sciences and includes the most often used features of R in an appendix. In addition, each chapter provides a set of computational challenges: exercises in R calculations that are designed to be performed alone or in groups. Several of the chapters explore algebra concepts that are highly useful in scientific applications, such as quadratic equations, systems of linear equations, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions. Each chapter provides an instructional review of the algebra concept, followed by a hands-on guide to performing calculations and graphing in R. R is intuitive, even fun. Fantastic, publication-quality graphs of data, equations, or both can be produced with little effort. By integrating mathematical computation and scientific illustration early in a student{'}s development, R use can enhance one{'}s understanding of even the most difficult scientific concepts. While R has gained a strong reputation as a package for statistical analysis, The R Student Companion approaches R more completely as a comprehensive tool for scientific computing and graphing.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on a new statistical test for detecting density dependence in univariate time series observations of population abundances. The test is a likelihood ratio test-based on a discrete time stochastic logistic model. The null hypothesis is that the population is undergoing stochastic exponential growth, stochastic exponential decline, or random walk. The distribution of the test statistic under both the null and alternate hypotheses is obtained through parametric bootstrapping. We document the power of the test with extensive simulations and show how some previous tests in the literature for density dependence suffer from either excessive Type I or excessive Type Il error. The new test appears robust against sampling or measurement error in the observations. In fact, under certain types of error the power of the new lest is actually increased. Example analyses of elk (Cervus elaphus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) data sets are provided. The model implies that density-dependent populations do not have a point equilibrium, but rather reach a stochastic equilibrium (stationary distribution of population abundance). The model and associated statistical methods have potentially important applications in conservation biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Agricultural change is often cited as a causal factor in the decline of the UK{'}s farmland birds because bird declines have mirrored changes in agricultural practices. Although much is known about the mechanisms driving population declines on arable systems, mechanisms in grassland systems are relatively poorly studied, despite receiving a similar degree of intensification. Agricultural intensification may affect bird declines by reducing food abundance or accessibility, forager mobility or predation risk. Here we examine experimentally the effects of sward height on the foraging behaviour of adult Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris, and the effects of sward height and drainage on the behaviour of Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus chicks. Both species are declining across the UK and both forage in farmed grassland habitats, but they differ in their foraging methods because Starlings probe for soil invertebrates whereas Lapwing chicks glean prey from surfaces. Overall, after controlling for prey abundance, short swards were found to be more productive for both species. Prey capture rate within foraging bouts did not differ with sward height for Starlings, but Starlings spent more time foraging on short swards and captured 33.2% more prey. Starlings walked more steps on short swards. Lapwing chick foraging rates declined as sward height increased. Soil moisture was not found to be a predictor of Lapwing chick foraging rates within the observed range. Our results suggest that short swards are a more profitable foraging habitat for soil and surface invertebrate feeders. Short swards may facilitate surface prey detection, improve forager mobility and increase foraging time by altering vigilance patterns. Provision of short swards in areas where these are lacking could be simple method of improving foraging habitats for grassland birds.},

  Abstract                 = {When a community of species is sampled, nonappearing species are not those with abundances that fall shy of some arbitrary mark, the "veil line" proposed by E. F. Preston in 1948 (Ecology29, 254-283). Instead, they follow a hypergeometric distribution, which has no resemblance to the veil line. There is therefore no justification for the truncation of distributions proposed to describe the abundances of species in natural communities. The mistake of the veil line points to the need for a general theory of sampling. If a community has a distributiongof species abundances and if samples taken of the community tend to follow distributionf, what is the relationship offtog? The seeds of such a theory are available in the work of E. C. Pielou. Using the Poisson distribution as a close approximation to the hypergeometric, one may immediately write and (in most cases) solve the transformation fromgtof. The transformation appears to preserve distribution formulas to within constants and parameters, providing yet another reason to rule out the use of truncation. Well beyond this application, the theory provides a foundation for rethinking the sampling process and its implications for ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {According to almost any approach to statistical inference, attained significance levels, or p values, have little value. Despite this consensus among statistical experts, p values are usually reported extensively in research articles in a manner that invites misinterpretation. In the present article, I suggest that the reason p values are so heavily used is because they provide information concerning the strength of the evidence provided by the experiment. In some typical hypothesis testing situations, researchers may be interested in the relative adequacy of two different theoretical accounts: one that predicts no difference across conditions, and another that predicts some difference. The appropriate statistic for this kind of comparison is the likelihood ratio, P(D/M-0)/P(D/M-1), where M-0 and M-1 are the two theoretical accounts. Large values of the likelihood ratio provide evidence that M-0 is a better account, whereas small values indicate that M-1 is better. I demonstrate that, under some circumstances, the p value can be interpreted in the same manner as the likelihood ratio. Ln particular, for Z, t, and sign tests, the likelihood ratio is an approximately linear function of the p value, with a slope between 2 and 3. Thus, researchers may report p values in scientific communications because they are a proxy for the likelihood ratio and provide the readers with information about the strength of the evidence that is not otherwise available.},

  Abstract                 = {Intake rates of snow buntings feeding on artificial seed patches were measured at different bird densities, for each of two different seed densities. Interference occurred in the low seed-density treatment, with intake rates declining at high bird densities. However, interference was not found in the high seed-density treatment. The finding that the strength of interference may depend on resource density contradicts the hypothesis that the functional response is ratio-dependent (Arditi and Akcakaya 1990). The formulation for interference from Hassell and Varley (1969), and the models of Beddington (1975), Ruxton et al. (1992) and Holmgren (1995), also assume that the strength of interference is independent of resource density. The development of behaviour-based models that consider the relation between the intensity of interference, resource density and individual state may provide a more accurate description of the process of interference.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The spread and intensification of agriculture are recognized as two of the most important global threats to wildlife. There are clear links between agricultural change and declines in biodiversity across a wide range of agricultural systems, and convincing evidence that reversing these changes leads to a recovery in wildlife populations. 2. Nearly 4 billion euros are now paid annually through agri-environment schemes (AES) to farmers in Europe and North America to make environmental improvements to their land. Where appropriately designed and targeted, these schemes have proved successful in reversing declines in farmland wildlife populations. 3. We argue that insights gained from island biogeography and metapopulation theory, and from theoretical and empirical assessments of landscape connectivity suggest that AES may carry substantial wider benefits, which so far have not been considered in the design and deployment of such schemes. {'}Softening{'} agricultural land could offset some of the negative impacts on biodiversity of the loss and fragmentation of non-agricultural habitats; could allow species to adapt to climate change; could slow the spread of alien and invasive species; and could contribute positively to the coherence of key biodiversity and protected area networks. Indeed, AES might represent the only viable way to counter these threats. 4. We outline a number of ways in which these wider benefits could be taken account of in the design of AES and suggest a number of characteristics of the species most likely to benefit from them. 5. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes might bring significant environmental benefits to habitats other than farmland by restoring the agricultural matrix that separates them. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that matrix restoration improves a number of ecosystem functions. Where they are available, AES might therefore represent a viable mechanism for addressing a range of pandemic environmental problems such as global climate change. Little consideration has so far been given to these wider conservation applications in the design, deployment and monitoring of AES.},

  Abstract                 = {1. There are multiple tools for scientific inference that seem rarely used in research examining the effects of stressors on rivers caused by human impacts. Very few of these scientific tools are {'}new{'}. While foundational to scientific methods, they seem to have been overlooked or forgotten. The thesis of this paper is that, by looking back to what used to be considered basic knowledge about scientific methods and the discipline of ecology, we may re-learn some useful ways of improving survey designs and re-framing scientific questions. 2. Two common barriers to strong inference are examined in detail in this paper: disentangling the effects of different stressors, so that we can confidently infer which ones are the causes of unacceptable environmental changes; and dealing with high variability among replicate observations. Poor information about causality means managers cannot know what rehabilitation or amelioration should be attempted. Poor fits of models to data lower confidence in inference. Commonly proffered solutions, which include large sample sizes; choosing {'}representative reaches{'}; or using complex multivariate statistics, do not solve these problems. 3. The solutions lie within the basic components of good experimental design, which apply as much to surveys as they do to experiments. Several pieces of practical advice are offered and explained, which include (i) the necessity to specify a precise mechanism of cause and effect in hypotheses, and what changes to common approaches this entails; (ii) some difficulties caused by scale-ups that are implicit in the selection and measurement of variables, which necessitate changes to some standard protocols; (iii) the value of planned comparisons in surveys as ways of strengthening inference and employing approaches, like control species, where other forms of controls cannot be gained; (iv) the necessity to view random sampling as essential to the selection of sites, which means we should abandon the notion of {'}representative{'} reaches; (v) to use sample compositing and sub-sampling to optimise sampling effort at those replicates that provide degrees of freedom for hypothesis tests while cutting costs (vi) to be open to new forms of analysis, like quantile regression, which tests non-traditional hypotheses about constraints, rather than mean or central responses, and which deals much better with sorting between the effects of multiple stressors. 4. Thematic implications: sorting between the effects of multiple stressors caused by human impacts needs the best possible scientific inference we can apply. Common forms of studies in the modern stream literature suggest we collectively know less now than we did 40-50 years ago because some fundamental aspects of strong inference and basic knowledge in ecology seem to have been forgotten or lost. This raises questions about the quality of ecological training provided at universities. Although some aspects of good design are seen as {'}too expensive{'}, cost per se is relative. A well-designed programme that has been optimised for the funds available is far cheaper than the costs of poorly designed surveys that provide inaccurate information and predictions, which are more likely to lead to poor management decisions.},

Here, we use the data on the introduction of five South African dung beetle species to Australia to test whether CEMs developed in the native range can predict distribution in the introduced range, where the confounding effects of dispersal limitation, resource limitation and the impact of natural enemies have been removed, leaving climate as the dominant constraint. For two of the five species, models developed in the native range predict distribution in the introduced range about as well as models developed in the introduced range where we know climate limits distribution. For the remaining three species, models developed in the native range perform poorly, implying that non-climatic factors limit the native distribution of these species and need to be accounted for in species distribution models. Quantifying relevant non-climatic factors and their likely interactions with climatic variables for forecasting range shifts under climate change remains a challenging task.},

  Abstract                 = {The first edition of this excellent handbook was extremely well received by both students and lecturers alike. It has helped to simplify the often complex and difficult task of choosing and using the right statistics package.This is a book for any student or professional biologist who wants to process data using a statistical package on the computer, to select appropriate methods, and extract the important information from the often confusing output that is produced. It is aimed primarily at undergraduates and masters students in the biological sciences who have to apply statistics in practical classes and projects. Such users of statistics do not have to understand either how tests work or how to do the calculations, and these aspects are not covered in the book.The new edition has been updated to cover the very latest versions of the computer packages described, expanded to include coverage for logistic regression, a more detailed consideration of multivariate analysis, data exploration and further examples of Principle Component Analysis and Discriminate Function Analysis are given. New edition will use SPSS 10.0, Minitab 13.1 and Excel 2000. New simplified version of the Key and flow chart of decisions to reach simple statistical tests. Section on multivariate techniques expanded to give further examples of PCA and DFA. Aimed at students using statistics for projects and in practical classes. Statistical jargon explained through an extensive glossary and key to symbols. Stresses the importance of experimental design, measurement of data and interpretation of results rather than an understanding of the statistical tests themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {Newcomers to R are often intimidated by the command-line interface, the vast number of functions and packages, or the processes of importing data and performing a simple statistical analysis. The R Primer provides a collection of concise examples and solutions to R problems frequently encountered by new users of this statistical software. Rather than explore the many options available for every command as well as the ever-increasing number of packages, the book focuses on the basics of data preparation and analysis and gives examples that can be used as a starting point. The numerous examples illustrate a specific situation, topic, or problem, including data importing, data management, classical statistical analyses, and high-quality graphics production. Each example is self-contained and includes R code that can be run exactly as shown, enabling results from the book to be replicated. While base R is used throughout, other functions or packages are listed if they cover or extend the functionality. After working through the examples found in this text, new users of R will be able to better handle data analysis and graphics applications in R.

  Abstract                 = {Most habitat maps are presented as if they were a certain fact, with no indication of uncertainties. In many cases, researchers faced with the task of constructing such maps are aware of problems with the modelling data and of decisions that they make within the modelling process that are likely to affect the output, but they find it difficult to quantify this information. In some cases they attempt to evaluate the modelled predictions against independent data, but the summary statistics have no spatial component and do not address errors in the predictions. It is proposed that maps of uncertainty would help in the interpretation of these summaries, and to emphasize patterns in uncertainty such as spatial clustering or links with particular covariates. This paper reviews the aspects of uncertainty that are relevant to habitat maps developed with logistic regression, and suggests methods for investigating and communicating these uncertainties. It addresses the problems of subjective judgement, model uncertainty and vague concepts along with the more commonly considered uncertainties of random and systematic error. Methods for developing realistic confidence intervals are presented along with suggestions on how to visualize the information for use by decision-makers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Current circumstances - that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence-only data (e.g. from museums and herbaria), and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions - mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. Such methods must, in particular, accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. Here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties, analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions, but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a Geographic Information System. MARS also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses, meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. We use data from 226 species from six regions of the world, and demonstrate the use of MARS for distribution modelling using presence-only data. We test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance, by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence-absence data were recorded. Models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence-only sites for a biological group, and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables, performed better than models in which species were analysed singly, or in which pseudo-absences were drawn randomly from the study area. The methods are fast, relatively simple to understand, and useful for situations where data are limited. A tutorial is included.},

  Abstract                 = {In our statistical practice, we ecologists work comfortably within the hypothetico-deductive epistemology of Popper and the frequentist statistical methodology of Fisher. Consequently, our null hypotheses do not often take into account pre-existing data and do not require parameterization, our experiments demand large sample sizes, and we rarely use results from one experiment to predict the outcomes of future experiments. Comparative statistical statements such as {`}{'}we reject the null hypothesis st the 0.05 level,{''} which reflect the likelihood of our data given our hypothesis, are of little use in communicating our results to nonspecialists or in describing the degree of certitude we have in our conclusions. In contrast, Bayesian statistical inference requires the explicit assignment of prior probabilities, based on existing information, to the outcomes of experiments. Such an assignment forces the parameterization of null and alternative hypotheses. The results of these experiments, regardless of sample size, then can be used to compute posterior probabilities of our hypotheses given the available data. Inferential conclusions in a Bayesian mode also are mon meaningful in environmental policy discussions: e.g., {`}{'}our experiments indicate that there is a 95% probability that acid deposition will affect northeastern conifer forests.{''} Based on comparisons with current statistical practice in ecology, I argue that a {`}{'}Bayesian ecology{''} would (a) make better use of pre-existing data; (b) allow stronger conclusions to be drawn from large-scale experiments with few replicates; and (c) be more relevant to environmental decision-making.},

  Abstract                 = {A wide variety of data sets produced by individual investigators are now synthesized to address ecological questions that span a range of spatial and temporal scales. It is important to facilitate such syntheses so that "consumers" of data sets can be confident that both input data sets and synthetic products are reliable. Necessary documentation to ensure the reliability and validation of data sets includes both familiar descriptive metadata and formal documentation of the scientific processes used (i.e., process metadata) to produce usable data sets from collections of raw data. Such documentation is complex and difficult to construct, so it is important to help "producers" create reliable data sets and to facilitate their creation of required metadata. We describe a formal representation, an "analytic web," that aids both producers and consumers of data sets by providing complete and precise definitions of scientific processes used to process raw and derived data sets. The formalisms used to define analytic webs are adaptations of those used in software engineering, and they provide a novel and effective support system for both the synthesis and the validation of ecological data sets. We illustrate the utility of an analytic web as an aid to producing synthetic data sets through a worked example: the synthesis of long-term measurements of whole-ecosystem carbon exchange. Analytic webs are also useful validation aids for consumers because they support the concurrent construction of a complete, Internet-accessible audit trail of the analytic processes used in the synthesis of the data sets. Finally we describe our early efforts to evaluate these ideas through the use of a prototype software tool, SciWalker. We indicate how this tool has been used to create analytic webs tailored to specific data-set synthesis and validation activities, and suggest extensions to it that will support additional forms of validation. The process metadata created by SciWalker is readily adapted for inclusion in Ecological Metadata Language (EML) files.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advancement of statistical methodology inextricably linked to the use of computers, new methodological ideas must be translated into usable code and then numerically evaluated relative to competing procedures. In response to this, Statistical Computing in C++ and R concentrates on the writing of code rather than the development and study of numerical algorithms per se. The book discusses code development in C++ and R and the use of these symbiotic languages in unison. It emphasizes that each offers distinct features that, when used in tandem, can take code writing beyond what can be obtained from either language alone. The text begins with some basics of object-oriented languages, followed by a {``}boot-camp{''} on the use of C++ and R. The authors then discuss code development for the solution of specific computational problems that are relevant to statistics including optimization, numerical linear algebra, and random number generation. Later chapters introduce abstract data structures (ADTs) and parallel computing concepts. The appendices cover R and UNIX Shell programming. The translation of a mathematical problem into its computational analog (or analogs) is a skill that must be learned, like any other, by actively solving relevant problems. The text reveals the basic principles of algorithmic thinking essential to the modern statistician as well as the fundamental skill of communicating with a computer through the use of the computer languages C++ and R. The book lays the foundation for original code development in a research environment.},

  Abstract                 = {While theoretical statistics relies primarily on mathematics and hypothetical situations, statistical practice is a translation of a question formulated by a researcher into a series of variables linked by a statistical tool. As with written material, there are almost always differences between the meaning of the original text and translated text. Additionally, many versions can be suggested, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Analysis of Questionnaire Data with R translates certain classic research questions into statistical formulations. As indicated in the title, the syntax of these statistical formulations is based on the well-known R language, chosen for its popularity, simplicity, and power of its structure. Although syntax is vital, understanding the semantics is the real challenge of any good translation. In this book, the semantics of theoretical-to-practical translation emerges progressively from examples and experience, and occasionally from mathematical considerations. Sometimes the interpretation of a result is not clear, and there is no statistical tool really suited to the question at hand. Sometimes data sets contain errors, inconsistencies between answers, or missing data. More often, available statistical tools are not formally appropriate for the given situation, making it difficult to assess to what extent this slight inadequacy affects the interpretation of results. Analysis of Questionnaire Data with R tackles these and other common challenges in the practice of statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {The {``}problem of three prisoners{''}, a counterintuitive teaser, is analyzed. It is representative of a class of probability puzzles where the correct solution depends on explication of underlying assumptions. Spontaneous beliefs concerning the problem and intuitive heuristics are reviewed. The psychological background of these beliefs is explored. Several attempts to find a simple criterion to predict whether and how the probability of the target event will change as a result of obtaining evidence are examined. However, despite the psychological appeal of these attempts, none proves to be valid in general. A necessary and sufficient condition for change in the probability of the target event, following observation of new data, is proposed. That criterion is an extension of the likelihood-ratio principle (which holds in the case of only two complementary alternatives) to any number of alternatives. Some didactic implications concerning the significance of the chance set-up and reliance on analogies are discussed.},

We present new data from a student sample and examples from the psychological literature showing the strength and prevalence of this illusion. We identify some intrinsic cognitive mechanisms (similarity to modus tollens reasoning; verbal ambiguity in describing the meaning of significance tests; and the need to rule out chance findings) and extrinsic social pressures which help to maintain the illusion. We conclude by mentioning some alternative methods for presenting and analyzing psychological data, none of which can be considered the ultimate method.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the concept of the Mahalanobis distance to bioclimatic modeling. Specifically, we argue that climatic envelopes defined by the Mahalanobis distance produce more accurate predictions of species distribution than standard rectilinear envelopes (e.g. those produced by BIOCLIM). We base our hypothesis on three rationales: (1) the climatic envelope generated by the Mahalanobis distance is oblique, and therefore, may cope with correlations and interactions among the climatic variables; (2) the Mahalanobis envelope is elliptic, a rid therefore, better reflects the principle of central tendency as expressed by niche theory; (3) Mahalanobian predictions are based on the whole data rather than on the outermost observations, and are therefore, less sensitive to outliers. We test our hypothesis using data on the distribution of 192 species of woody plants in Israel. Validation tests based on four measures of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy and the Kappa statistic) support our hypothesis, and suggest that Mahalanobis models produce predictions that are significantly more accurate than those produced by corresponding rectilinear models. Additional simulation experiments demonstrate that the superiority of Mahalanobian models cannot be related to their elliptic-shape, of their ability to cope with correlations among the climatic variables. Accordingly, our conclusion is that the prime advantage of Mahalanobian models originates from the fact that their climatic envelopes are defined using all the observations, as opposed to rectilinear envelopes that are founded on the outermost observations.

We developed distributional predictions (ecological niche models) for 89 species occurring in dry tropical forest in the Balsas Basin of south-western Mexico using an interpolation technique, and predicted the species likely to occur at 8 sites across the region. Onsite field inventory data were then used to test the community predictions, all of which were statistically significant. These results suggest that inventory efforts can be made more efficient by development beforehand of hypotheses that focus onsite collecting and inventory.},

The numbers of captures per species per unit time, analyzed under different simplifying assumptions, reveal a set of species-loss curves. From those declining numbers, we derive a scaling rule for the time it takes to lose half the species in a fragment as a function of its area. A 10-fold decrease in the rate of species loss requires a 1,000-fold increase in area. Fragments of 100 hectares lose one half of their species in \textless15 years, too short a time for implementing conservation measures.},

We developed predictive models of ecological and spatial distributions of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) using ecological niche modeling. Most Occurrences of capybaras were in flat areas with water bodies Surrounded by sugarcane and pasture. More than 75% of the Piracicaba River basin was estimated as potentially habitable by capybara. The models had low omission error (2.3-3.4%), but higher commission error (91.0-98.5%); these "model failures" seem to be more related to local habitat characteristics than to spatial ones. The potential distribution of capybaras in the basin is associated with anthropogenic habitats, particularly with intensive land use for agriculture. },

GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},

We suggest ten guiding principles to help maintain biodiversity, ecosystem function, and resilience in production landscapes. Landscapes should include structurally characteristic patches of native vegetation, corridors and stepping stones between them, a structurally complex matrix, and buffers around sensitive areas. Management should maintain a diversity of species within and across functional groups. Highly focused management actions may be required to maintain keystone species and threatened species, and to control invasive species. These guiding principles provide a scientifically defensible starting point for the integration of conservation and production, which is urgently required from both an ecological and a long-term economic perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {While poleward species migration in response to recent climatic warming is widely documented, few studies have examined entire range responses of broadly distributed sessile organisms, including changes on both the trailing (equatorward) and the leading (poleward) range edges. From a detailed population census throughout the entire geographical range of Aloe dichotoma Masson, a long-lived Namib Desert tree, together with data from repeat photographs, we present strong evidence that a developing range shift in this species is a {'}fingerprint{'} of anthropogenic climate change. This is explained at a high level of statistical significance by population level impacts of observed regional warming and resulting water balance constraints. Generalized linear models suggest that greater mortalities and population declines in equatorward populations are virtually certainly the result, due to anthropogenic climate change, of the progressive exceedance of critical climate thresholds that are relatively closer to the species{'} tolerance limits in equatorward sites. Equatorward population declines are also broadly consistent with bioclimatically modelled projections under anticipated anthropogenic climate change but, as yet, there is no evidence of poleward range expansion into the area predicted to become suitable in future, despite good evidence for positive population growth trends in poleward populations. This study is among the first to show a marked lag between trailing edge population extinction and leading edge range expansion in a species experiencing anthropogenic climate change impacts, a pattern likely to apply to most sessile and poorly dispersed organisms. This provides support for conservative assumptions of species{'} migration rates when modelling climate change impacts for such species. Aloe dichotoma{'}s response to climate change suggests that desert ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate change than previously suspected.},

The distributions of these species are poorly known, although detailed information could benefit malaria vector incrimination and control. We used published collection records of these species and environmental geospatial data to construct consensus ecological niche models (ENM) of each species{'} potential geographic distribution. The status of the Indian taxon An. fluviatilis S as a species distinct from An. harrisoni has been debated in the literature, so we tested for differentiation in ecological niche characteristics. The predicted potential distribution of An. minimus is more southerly than that of An. harrisoni: Southeast Asia is predicted to be more suitable for An. minimus, and China and India are predicted more suitable for An. harrisoni, so An. harrisoni seems to dominate under cooler conditions. The distribution of An. minimus is more continuous than that of An. harrisoni: disjunction in the potential distribution of the latter is suggested between India and Southeast Asia. Anopheles fluviatilis S occurrences are predicted within the An. harrisoni ecological potential, so we do not document ecological differentiation that might reject conspecificity. Overall, model predictions offer a synthetic view of the distribution of this species complex across the landscapes of southern and eastern Asia. },

We investigated the potential geographic range of the invasive paleotropical weed, smooth crotalaria, in protected natural areas across Brazil. The ecological niche dimensions of smooth crotalaria in Africa (its putative original distribution) were modeled using a genetic algorithm. Models for the native range and their projections to South America showed good predictive ability when challenged with independent occurrence data. All Brazilian protected natural areas were predicted as highly vulnerable to invasion by this species. However, smooth crotalaria appears more likely to occur in open (savanna-like vegetation, such as cerrado and pantanal) and highly fragmented (Atlantic forest) areas than in extensive closed forests (Amazon). Management suggestions and research priorities are outlined based on these results.},

  Abstract                 = {The many criticisms of null hypothesis testing suggest when it is not useful and what is should not be used for. This article explores when and why its use is appropriate. Null hypothesis testing is insufficient when size of effect is important, but it is ideal for testing ordinal claims relating the order of conditions, which are common in psychology. Null hypothesis testing also is insufficient for determining beliefs, but it is ideal for demonstrating sufficient evidential strength to support an ordinal claim, with sufficient evidence being 1 criterion for a finding entering the corpus of legitimate findings in psychology. The line between sufficient and insufficient evidence is currently set at p < .05; there is little reason for allowing experimenters to select their own value of alpha. Thus null hypothesis testing is an optimal method for demonstrating sufficient evidence for an ordinal claim.},

  Abstract                 = { Spatial statistics are useful in subjects as diverse as climatology, ecology, economics, environmental and earth sciences, epidemiology, image analysis and more. This book covers the best-known spatial models for three types of spatial data: geostatistical data (stationarity, intrinsic models, variograms, spatial regression and space-time models), areal data (Gibbs-Markov fields and spatial auto-regression) and point pattern data (Poisson, Cox, Gibbs and Markov point processes). The level is relatively advanced, and the presentation concise but complete. The most important statistical methods and their asymptotic properties are described, including estimation in geostatistics, autocorrelation and second-order statistics, maximum likelihood methods, approximate inference using the pseudo-likelihood or Monte-Carlo simulations, statistics for point processes and Bayesian hierarchical models. A chapter is devoted to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (Gibbs sampler, Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and exact simulation). A large number of real examples are studied with R, and each chapter ends with a set of theoretical and applied exercises. While a foundation in probability and mathematical statistics is assumed, three appendices introduce some necessary background. The book is accessible to senior undergraduate students with a solid math background and Ph.D. students in statistics. Furthermore, experienced statisticians and researchers in the above-mentioned fields will find the book valuable as a mathematically sound reference.

  Abstract                 = {Understanding of the determinants of species{'} geographic range limits remains poorly integrated. In part, this is because of the diversity of perspectives on the issue, and because empirical studies have lagged substantially behind developments in theory. Here, I provide a broad overview, drawing together many of the disparate threads, considering, in turn, how influences on the terms of a simple single-population equation can determine range limits. There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite its wide implications for many ecological issues, the global pattern of spatial turnover in the occurrence of species has been little studied, unlike the global pattern of species richness. Here, using a database on the breeding distributions of birds, we present the first global maps of variation in spatial turnover for an entire taxonomic class, a pattern that has to date remained largely a matter of conjecture, based on theoretical expectations and extrapolation of inconsistent patterns from different biogeographic realms. We use these maps to test four predictions from niche theory as to the form that this variation should take, namely that turnover should increase with species richness, towards lower latitudes, and with the steepness of environmental gradients and that variation in turnover is determined principally by rare (restricted) species. Contrary to prediction, we show that turnover is high both in areas of extremely low and high species richness, does not increase strongly towards the tropics, and is related both to average environmental conditions and spatial variation in those conditions. These results are closely associated with a further important and novel finding, namely that global patterns of spatial turnover are driven principally by widespread species rather than the restricted ones. This complements recent demonstrations that spatial patterns of species richness are also driven principally by widespread species, and thus provides an important contribution towards a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth{'}s major land masses.},

  Abstract                 = {Natural history collections are crucial resources for conservation biology, particularly given the development of the ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach. We combined ENM with taxonomic investigations to address ecological, geographic, and phenotypic variation in the poorly known central African rainforest genets (Genetta cristata, Genetta servalina, Genetta victoriae) to provide new insights into their conservation status. Taxonomic identification was based on four discrete morphological characters. ENMs were developed using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), 10 environmental data layers and 310 georeferenced localities extracted from 667 museum specimens and 22 literature sources. Re-assessed taxonomic identifications allowed us to expand significantly the known range and ecological limits of the three genets. We suggested limited hybridization between G. cristata and G. servalina, in a zone of sympatry likely to cover central Cameroon, northwestern Gabon and Congo. ENM showed that almost all known occurrences were connected geographically by suitable ecological conditions, suggesting continuous potential distributions between supposedly isolated populations of the three genets. Our investigations indicated that G. cristata is distinct from G. servalina in morphology, geographic ranges and ecological niches, indicating species status for G. cristata, which, as such, should be the subject of appropriate conservation attention. Areas of predicted connectivity and actual zones of occurrence falling outside current forest cover should be surveyed to re-assess the status of the rainforest genets. Our study shows that combining ENM and taxonomic investigations can substantially improve data utilization from natural history collections, especially in the case of poorly known species.

If such a man tests positive, the chance that he is infected can be as low as 50%. We study what information counsellors communicate to clients concerning the meaning of a positive test and whether they communicate this information in a way the client can understand. To get realistic data, one of us visited as a client 20 public health centres in Germany to rake 20 counselling sessions and HIV tests, A majority of the counsellors explained that false positives do not occur, and half of the counsellors told the client that if he tests positive, it is 100% certain that he is infected with the virus. Counsellors communicated numerical information in terms of probabilities rather than absolute frequencies, became confused, and were inconsistent. Based on experimental evidence, we propose a simple method that counsellors can learn to communicate risks in a more effective way.},

  Abstract                 = {Plague in Brazil is poorly known and now rarely seen, so studies of its ecology are difficult. We used ecological niche models of historical (1966-present) records of human plague cases across northeastern Brazil to assess hypotheses regarding environmental correlates of plague occurrences across the region. Results indicate that the apparently focal distribution of plague in northeastern Brazil is indeed discontinuous, and that the causes of the discontinuity are not necessarily only related to elevation-rather, a diversity of environmental dimensions correlate to presence of plague foci in the region. Perhaps most interesting is that suitable areas for plague show marked seasonal variation in photosynthetic mass, with peaks in April and May, suggesting links to particular land cover types. Next steps in this line of research will require more detailed and specific examination of reservoir ecology and natural history. },

  Abstract                 = {The book explains tools for computational finance. It covers fundamental numerical analysis and computational techniques, for example for option pricing, but two topics are given special attention: simulation and optimization. Many chapters are organized as case studies, dealing with problems like portfolio insurance or risk estimation; in particular, several chapters explain optimization heuristics and how to use them for portfolio selection or the calibration of option pricing models. Such practical examples allow readers to learn the required steps for solving specific problems, and to apply these steps to other problems, too. At the same time, the chosen applications are relevant enough to make the book a useful reference on how to handle given problems. Matlab and R sample code is provided in the text and can be downloaded from the book{'}s website; an R package {`}NMOF{'} is also available.},

  Abstract                 = {A predator{'}s per capita feeding rate on prey, or its functional response, provides a foundation for predator{--}prey theory. Since 1959, Holling{'}s prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator{--}prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator{--}prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington- DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator{--}prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms, we suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge into a statistical analysis. This prior knowledge is usually restricted to assumptions regarding the form of probability distributions of the parameters of interest, leaving their values to be determined mainly through the data. Here we show how a Bayesian approach can be applied to the problem of drawing inference regarding species abundance distributions and comparing diversity indices between sites. The classic log series and the lognormal models of relative- abundance distribution are apparently quite different in form. The first is a sampling distribution while the other is a model of abundance of the underlying population. Bayesian methods help unite these two models in a common framework. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation can be used to fit both distributions as small hierarchical models with shared common assumptions. Sampling error can be assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. Species not found in a sample, but suspected to be present in the region or community of interest, can be given zero abundance. This not only simplifies the process of model fitting, but also provides a convenient way of calculating confidence intervals for diversity indices. The method is especially useful when a comparison of species diversity between sites with different sample sizes is the key motivation behind the research. We illustrate the potential of the approach using data on fruit-feeding butterflies in southern Mexico. We conclude that, once all assumptions have been made transparent, a single data set may provide support for the belief that diversity is negatively affected by anthropogenic forest disturbance. Bayesian methods help to apply theory regarding the distribution of abundance in ecological communities to applied conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value{'}s inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes{'} factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The mathematics and logic of evidential theory are presented, with the log-likelihood ratio used as the measure of evidence. The profoundly different philosophy behind evidential methods (as compared to traditional ones) is presented, as well as a comparative example showing the difference between the two approaches. The reasons why we mistakenly ascribe evidential meaning to p-values and related measures are discussed. Unfamiliarity with the technology and philosophy of evidence is seen as the main reason why certain arguments about p-values persist, and why they are frequently contradictory and confusing.},

Although we agree with most critics{'} catalogs of NHT{'}s flaws, this article also takes the unusual stance of identifying virtues that may explain why NHT continues to be so extensively used. These virtues include providing results in the form of a dichotomous (yes/no) hypothesis evaluation and providing an index (p value) that has a justifiable mapping onto confidence in repeatability of a null hypothesis rejection. The most-criticized flaws of NHT can be avoided when the importance of a hypothesis, rather than the p value of its test, is used to determine that a finding is worthy of report, and when p congruent to .05 is treated as insufficient basis for confidence in the replicability of an isolated non-null finding. Together with many recent critics of NHT, we also urge reporting of important hypothesis tests in enough descriptive detail to permit secondary uses such as meta-analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of evolutionary units (species, populations) requires integrating several kinds of data, such as genetic or phenotypic markers or spatial information in order to get a comprehensive view concerning the differentiation of the units. We propose a statistical model with a double original advantage: (i) it incorporates information about the spatial distribution of the samples, with the aim to increase inference power and to relate more explicitly observed patterns to geography and (ii) it allows one to analyze genetic and phenotypic data within a unified model and inference framework, thus opening the way to robust comparisons between markers and possibly combined analyses. We show from simulated data as well as real data that our method estimates parameters accurately and is an improvement over alternative approaches in many situations. The power of this method is exemplified using an intricate case of inter- and intraspecies differentiation based on an original data set of georeferenced genetic and morphometric markers obtained on Myodes voles from Sweden.

Despite widespread use of models, there are still important conceptual ambiguities as well as biotic and algorithmic uncertainties that need to be investigated in order to increase confidence in model results. We identify and discuss five areas of enquiry that are of high importance for species distribution modelling: (1) clarification of the niche concept; (2) improved designs for sampling data for building models; (3) improved parameterization; (4) improved model selection and predictor contribution; and (5) improved model evaluation. The challenges discussed in this essay do not preclude the need for developments of other areas of research in this field. However, they are critical for allowing the science of species distribution modelling to move forward.},

  Abstract                 = {Because data on rare species usually are sparse, it is important to have efficient ways to sample additional data. Traditional sampling approaches are of limited value for rare species because a very large proportion of randomly chosen sampling sites are unlikely to shelter the species. For these species, spatial predictions from niche-based distribution models can be used to stratify the sampling and increase sampling efficiency. New data sampled are then used to improve the initial model. Applying this approach repeatedly is an adaptive process that may allow increasing the number of new occurrences found. We illustrate the approach with a case study of a rare and endangered plant species in Switzerland and a simulation experiment. Our field survey confirmed that the method helps in the discovery of new populations of the target species in remote areas where the predicted habitat suitability is high. In our simulations the model-based approach provided a significant improvement (by a factor of 1.8 to 4 times, depending on the measure) over simple random sampling. In terms of cost this approach may save up to 70% of the time spent in the field. D},

  Abstract                 = {Predictive species distribution modelling (SDM) has become an essential tool in biodiversity conservation and management. The choice of grain size (resolution) of environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling techniques to presence-only data for 50 species in five different regions, to test whether: (1) a 10-fold coarsening of resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs, and (2) any observed effects are dependent on the type of region, modelling technique, or species considered. Results show that a 10 times change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from species distribution models. The overall trend is towards degradation of model performance, but improvement can also be observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models across regions, techniques, and species types. The strongest effect is on regions and species types, with tree species in the data sets (regions) with highest locational accuracy being most affected. Changing grain size had little influence on the ranking of techniques: boosted regression trees remain best at both resolutions. The number of occurrences used for model training had an important effect, with larger sample sizes resulting in better models, which tended to be more sensitive to grain. Effect of grain change was only noticeable for models reaching sufficient performance and/or with initial data that have an intrinsic error smaller than the coarser grain size.},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

We compare 10 modeling techniques in terms of predictive power and sensitivity to location error, change in map resolution, and sample size, and assess whether some species traits can explain variation in model performance. We focused on 30 native tree species in Switzerland and used presence-only data to model current distribution, which we evaluated against independent presence absence data. While there are important differences between the predictive performance of modeling methods, the variance in model performance is greater among species than among techniques. Within the range of data perturbations in this study, some extrinsic parameters of data affect model performance more than others: location error and sample size reduced performance of many techniques, whereas grain had little effect on most techniques. No technique can rescue species that are difficult to predict. The predictive power of species-distribution models can partly be predicted from a series of species characteristics and traits based on growth rate, elevational distribution range, and maximum elevation. Slow-growing species or species with narrow and specialized niches tend to be better modeled. The Swiss presence-only tree data produce models that are reliable enough to be useful in planning and management applications.},

In this paper, we propose a bivariate differential equation motivated regression (DEMR) model, for the quantification of range shift curve of Aulax umbellata shrubs in Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. },

  Abstract                 = {Aim Conservation strategies currently include little consideration of climate change. Insights about the biotic impacts of climate change from biogeography and palaeoecology, therefore, have the potential to provide significant improvements in the effectiveness of conservation planning. We suggest a collaboration involving biogeography, ecology and applied conservation. The resulting Climate Change-integrated Conservation Strategies (CCS) apply available tools to respond to the conservation challenges posed by climate change. Location The focus of this analysis is global, with special reference to high biodiversity areas vulnerable to climate change, particularly tropical montane settings. Methods Current tools from climatology, biogeography and ecology applicable to conservation planning in response to climate change are reviewed. Conservation challenges posed by climate change are summarized. CCS elements are elaborated that use available tools to respond to these challenges. Results Five elements of CCS are described: regional modelling; expanding protected areas; management of the matrix; regional coordination; and transfer of resources. Regional modelling uses regional climate models, biotic response models and sensitivity analysis to identify climate change impacts on biodiversity at a regional scale appropriate for conservation planning. Expansion of protected areas management and systems within the planning region are based on modelling results. Management of the matrix between protected areas provides continuity for processes and species range shifts outside of parks. Regional coordination of park and off-park efforts allows harmonization of conservation goals across provincial and national boundaries. Finally, implementation of these CCS elements in the most biodiverse regions of the world will require technical and financial transfer of resources on a global scale. Main conclusions Collaboration across disciplines is necessary to plan conservation responses to climate change adequately. Biogeography and ecology provide insights into the effects of climate change on biodiversity that have not yet been fully integrated into conservation biology and applied conservation management. CCS provide a framework in which biogeographers, ecologists and conservation managers can collaborate to address this need. These planning exercises take place on a regional level, driven by regional climate models as well as general circulation models (GCMs), to ensure that regional climate drivers such as land use change and mesoscale topography are adequately represented. Sensitivity analysis can help address the substantial uncertainty inherent in projecting future climates and biodiversity response.},

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil{'}s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

This argues the need for a better balance in the literature and in statistical teaching between techniques and problem solving strategies.{''} Whether analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in observational studies, or developing predictive models, there are common problems that few regression texts address. For example, there are missing data in the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter (other than those used in textbooks!) but most regression texts do not include methods for dealing with such data effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover regression modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {There is an increasing consensus that global climate change occurs and that potential changes in climate are likely to have important regional consequences for biota and ecosystems. Ecological restoration, including (re)afforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land, is included in the array of potential human responses to climate change. However, the implications of climate change for the broader practice of ecological restoration must be considered. In particular, the usefulness of historical eco-system conditions as targets and references must be set against the likelihood that restoring these historic ecosystems is unlikely to be easy, or even possible, in the changed biophysical conditions of the future. We suggest that more consideration and debate needs to be directed at the implications of climate change for restoration practice.},

Chow{'}s decision to regard the similarity between data and prediction as being a dichotomous judgment made on the basis of significance testing is therefore unwise. I conclude that effect sizes are the single best index of the relationship between theoretical predictions and the obtained data.

  Abstract                 = {For a wide range of tests of single-df hypotheses, the sample size needed to achieve 50% power is readily approximated by setting N such that a significance test conducted on data that fit one{'}s assumptions perfectly just barely achieves statistical significance at one{'}s chosen alpha level. If the effect size assumed in establishing one{'}s N is the minimally important effect size (i.e., that effect size such that population differences or correlations smaller than that are not any practical or theoretical significance, whether statistically significant or not), then 50% power is optimal, because the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis should be greater than .5 when the population difference is of practical or theoretical significance but lower than .5 when it is not. Moreover, the actual power of the test in this case will be considerably higher than .5, exceeding .95 for a population difference two or more times as large as the minimally important difference (MID). This minimally important difference significant (MIDS) criterion extends naturally to specific comparisons following (or substituting for) overall tests such as the ANOVA F and chi-square for contingency tables, although the power of the overall test (i.e., the probability of finding some statistically significant specific comparison) is considerably greater than .5 when the MIDS criterion is applied to the overall test. However, the proper focus for power computations is one or more specific comparisons (rather than the omnibus test), and the MIDS criterion is well suited to setting sample size on this basis. Whereas N(MIDS) (the sample size specified by the MIDS criterion) is much too small for the case in which we wish to prove the modified H0 that there is no important population effect, it nonetheless provides a useful metric for specifying the necessary sample size. In particular, the sample size needed to have a 1 - alpha probability that the (1 - alpha)-level confidence interval around one{'}s population parameter includes no important departure from H0 is four times N(MIDS) when H0 is true and approximately [4/(1 - b)2]. N(MIDS) when b (the ratio between the actual population difference and the minimally important difference) is between zero and unity. The MIDS criterion for sample size provides a useful alternative to the methods currently most commonly employed and taught.},

Confidence intervals provide a useful addition to NHSTs, and can be used to provide the same sign-determination function as NHST. However, when so used, confidence intervals are subject to exactly the same Type I, II, and III error rates as NHST. In addition, NHSTs provide two pieces of information about our data-maximum probability of a Type III error and probability of a successful exact replication-that confidence intervals do not. The proposed alternative to NHST is just as susceptible to misinterpretation as is NHST. The problem of bias due to censoring of data collection or publication can be handled by providing archives for all methodologically sound data sets, but reserving interpretations and conclusions for statistically significant results.},

When he used a half-strength cerophyl medium thickened with methyl cellulose, the populations maintained sustained oscillations for 33 d before the experiment was terminated. The data from this experiment provide a rare opportunity to test current predator-prey models. A standard differential equation predator-prey model with a carrying capacity for the prey and a saturating (Type 2) functional response predicts the outcome Luckinbill{'}s experiment qualitatively, but does not give a good quantitative fit to the data, Several modifications of this model are tested against the data for the populations grown in the medium thickened with methyl cellulose, using the Marquardt-Levenberg method to obtain the least squares best fit. Neither Leslie type models nor models with a ratio-dependent functional response do well, but adding either predator mutual interference or a sigmoid (Type 3) functional response improves the fit dramatically. Modeling the predator growth rate to depend on energy or nutrient storage instead of directly on the rate of consumption of prey, thus creating a delayed numerical response, along with predator mutual interference or a sigmoid functional response, produced the best models and gave excellent fits to the data. These models are further validated by the fact that changing only one or two parameter values to reflect the unthickened medium or the half-strength medium also gives reasonably good fits to the other two data sets. The last model requires a more sigmoid functional response to fit the data in the thickened than in the unthickened medium, suggesting that an increase in the cost-benefit ratio of energy spent searching to energy gained capturing prey inhibits the predator searching at low prey densities.},

  Abstract                 = {Classic theory predicts species richness scales as the quarter-power of area, yet species-area relationships (SAR) vary widely depending on habitat, taxa, and scale range. Because power-law SAR are used to predict species loss under habitat loss, and to scale species richness from plots to biomes, insight into the wide variety of observed SAR and the conditions under which power-law behavior should be observed is needed. Here we derive from the maximum entropy principle, a new procedure for upscaling species richness data from small census plots to larger areas, and test empirically, using multiple data sets, the prediction that up to an overall scale displacement, nested SAR lie along a universal curve, with average abundance per species at each scale determining the local slope of the curve. Power-law behaviour only arises in the limit of increasing average abundance, and in that limit, the slope approaches zero, not 1/4. An extrapolation of tree species richness in the Western Ghats to biome scale (60 000 km(2)) using only census data at plot scale (1/4 ha) is presented to illustrate the potential for applications of our theory. },

  Abstract                 = {The ecological niche of a parasite exists only at the nexus of certain abiotic and biotic conditions suitable for both the definitive and intermediate hosts. However, the life cycles of most parasites are not known, or are poorly known, and using known ranges of hosts to find endemic parasitic infections has been difficult. However, with ecological niche modeling, we can create potential range maps using known localities of infection. Testing the validity of such maps requires knowledge of the localities of other parasites with common history. Here, we find that the ecological niche of a tapeworm parasite of voles, Paranoplocephala macrocephala (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae), allows prediction of the presence (in ecological and geographic space) of 19 related parasite species from 3 genera in 23 different hosts throughout the Nearctic. These results give credence to the idea that this group shares similar life cycle requirements despite phylogenetic distance. This work further validates ecological niche modeling as a means by which to predict occurrence of parasites when not all facets of the life cycle are confirmed. Such inductive methods create the opportunity for deducing potential reservoir or intermediate hosts, and complementing studies of parasite biodiversity and community ecology. },

  Abstract                 = {Species distribution models should provide conservation practioners with estimates of the spatial distributions of species requiring attention. These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox.},

  Abstract                 = {Responses of gas exchange and photosynthesis to changes in CO2 concentration and PPFD were examined in well watered plants of Delosperma tradescantioides Bgr. to establish the relative importance of these environmental changes on the photosynthetic machinery in this CAM-cycling species which grows naturally in both exposed and partly shaded environments. Plants were grown at two PPFDs (220 [LL] and 550 [HL] mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). HL plants had larger leaves with higher specific weight, water content and diurnal malic acid fluctuation. Photosynthetic PPFD responses were typically those of sun and shade species for HL and LL plants, both under 21% O-2 and non-photorespiratory (2% O-2) conditions. The CO2 compensation point in the absence of non-photorespirational CO2 evolution in the light (Gamma*) was c. 30 mu mol mol(-1). Irradiation reduced mitochondrial respiration by \textgreater 50%. Comparison of the PPFD responses of linear electron flow rates derived from gas exchange measurements and from fluorescence analysis (J(F)) indicated effective photosynthetic control. J(F) was always larger than electron flow rates calculated from gas exchange, indicating that processes other than carboxylation and oxygenation were consistently important in energy consumption under all sampled environmental conditions. Regardless of PPFD during growth, electron flow to carboxylation and J(F) were linearly correlated, demonstrating that the photosynthetic apparatus was well adapted to PPFD during growth. In HL plants, non-photochemical quenching increased, and photochemical quenching and the quantum yield of linear electron transport through PS II decreased more slowly with increasing PPFD than in LL plants. In plants of both treatments non-photochemical energy dissipation seemed to be exhausted when the proportion of photons not utilizable by photochemistry exceeded 0.7. Results illustrate a pronounced ability of D. tradescantioides to acclimate to a 100% change in the prevailing PPFD and lend support to the hypothesis that CAM cycling might act as a photoprotective process. },

Furthermore, the influence of short-term drought on malic acid accumulation and the activity of photosystem II (PSII) was studied to assess the possible interactions between drought and the prevailing PPFD in this species. HL plants showed features of sun versus shade acclimation relative to LL plants. Nocturnal malic acid accumulation (Delta-malate) and leaf water content also tended to be higher in HL plants. Irrespective of the PPFD during growth, the weak Delta-malate doubled within 3 days of drought. Despite largely restricted CO2 uptake, photosynthetic activity as estimated from fluorescence analysis declined only ca 5%. After 7 days of drought, when plants showed CAM-idling and Delta-malate had decreased again, potential carbon assimilation was still ca 84% of that in well-watered plants and remained relatively constant throughout the day. Decarboxylation of malic acid accounted for ca 23% of potential assimilation assuming total oxidation of a maximum portion of this organic acid. Drought did not affect predawn maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m). Non-photochemical quenching (q(N)) increased (24%) in response to desiccation and resulted in a more or less constant reduction state of PSII. This increase in q(N) resulted mainly from the change in its fast-relaxing component (q(NF)), while the slow component (q(NS)) was significant only at or above saturating PPFD in both HL and LL plants. The photon response characteristics of PSII, which differed between LL and HL plants, were unaffected by short-term drought. Photon harvesting and photon use were always adjusted to guarantee a low reduction state of PSII. Results suggest that in both LL and I-IL plants CAM-cycling may help to stabilize photosynthesis but to a large extent by other means than simply providing internally derived CO2. },

  Abstract                 = {Mountain fynbos ecosystems in South Africa are threatened by alien plant invasions and by a lack of funding for effective management of these invasions. This paper develops an ecological-economic argument for the effective management of plant invasions in mountain fynbos ecosystems. We do this by building a dynamic ecological economic model which values the ecosystem services that fynbos ecosystems provide under different management regimes. We propose that the services that mountain fynbos ecosystems provide fall into six components: water production, wildflower harvest, hiker visitation, ecotourist visitation, endemic species and genetic storage. A scenario analysis based on a hypothetical 4 km(2) mountain fynbos ecosystem in the western part of the fynbos biome estimated that the ecosystem{'}s value varies from R19 million (under low valuation and poor management scenario) to R300 million (under high valuation and good management scenario) [R4.50=US1]. Water production and genetic storage were the most valuable ecosystem services. The model showed that the cost of clearing alien plants (under the proactive management scenario) was a tiny (0.6-5%) proportion of the value of mountain fynbos ecosystems. This result motivates an injection of funds for clearing alien plants from mountain fynbos ecosystems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. },

  Abstract                 = {Methods of Statistical Model Estimation examines the most important and popular methods used to estimate parameters for statistical models and provide informative model summary statistics. Designed for R users, the book is also ideal for anyone wanting to better understand the algorithms used for statistical model fitting. The text presents algorithms for the estimation of a variety of regression procedures using maximum likelihood estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares regression, the EM algorithm, and MCMC sampling. Fully developed, working R code is constructed for each method. The book starts with OLS regression and generalized linear models, building to two-parameter maximum likelihood models for both pooled and panel models. It then covers a random effects model estimated using the EM algorithm and concludes with a Bayesian Poisson model using Metropolis-Hastings sampling. The book{'}s coverage is innovative in several ways. First, the authors use executable computer code to present and connect the theoretical content. Therefore, code is written for clarity of exposition rather than stability or speed of execution. Second, the book focuses on the performance of statistical estimation and downplays algebraic niceties.

  Abstract                 = {A feedforward artificial neural network, coupled with a regional GIS (geographic information system), is described that is being used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on a complex landscape of tropical forests. The model quantifies the relative suitability of environments for 15 forests classes using the best information that is available: a structural-environmental classification of forest types, vegetation maps and spatial estimates of environmental variables. Inputs to the model include climate variables, soil parent material classes and terrain variables. The model is highly successful at distinguishing the relative suitability of environments for the forest classes with 75% of the forest mosaic accurately predicted by the model at a one hectare resolution over more than two million hectares. The model was used to estimate potential forest distributions in several climates occurring since the end of the last glacial period. These distributions shift dramatically in response to scenarios representing past climates. Certain locations are occupied by a forest class in only some climates while others are always occupied by the same class despite large changes in regional mean annual temperature and precipitation. Using the model to assess the possible impacts of future climate change and estimating the pre-settlement distribution of forest types in the region is also discussed. The coupling of neural networks with a cellular automata model is also described as a means to assess the importance of spatial constraints on the potential redistribution of forest types in the future. The usefulness of artificial neural networks when applied to vegetation change studies in our region suggests that this approach could be applied in many tropical regions, where floristic diversity is high and mechanistic understanding is comparatively low.

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, {'}random{'}, {'}regular{'}, {'}proportional-stratified{'} and {'}equal -stratified{'}- to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/ absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson{'}s correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen{'}s K agreement coefficient. The results show the {'}regular{'} and {'}equal-stratified{'} sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design{'}.

I highlighted four main areas where progress in research can assist with this. First, we need to enhance the translation of recent advances in our understanding of ecosystem and landscape dynamics into the conceptual and practical frameworks for restoration. Second, we need to promote the development of an ability to correctly diagnose ecosystem damage, identify restoration thresholds, and develop corrective methodologies that aim to overcome such thresholds. This involves understanding which system characteristics are important in determining ecosystem recovery in a range of ecosystem types, and to what extent restoration measures need to overcome threshold and hysteresis effects. A third key requirement is to determine what realistic goals for restoration are based on the ecological realities of today and how these will change in the future, given ongoing changes in climate and land use. Finally, there is a need for a synthetic approach which draws together the ecological and social aspects of the issues surrounding restoration and the setting of restoration goals.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence from the Northern Hemisphere and simple theoretical models both predict that climate change could force southern African birds to undergo poleward range shifts. We document the chronology and habitat use of 18 regionally indigenous bird species that colonised the extreme south-western corner of Africa after the late 1940s. This incorporates a period of almost four decades of observed regional warming in the Western Cape, South Africa. Observations of these colonisation events concur with a {'}climate change{'} explanation, assuming extrapolation of Northern Hemisphere results and simplistic application of theory. However, on individual inspection, all bar one may be more parsimoniously explained by direct anthropogenic changes to the landscape than by the indirect effects of climate change. Indeed, no a priori predictions relating to climate change, such as colonisers being small and/or originating in nearby arid shrublands, were upheld. This suggests that observed climate changes have not yet been sufficient to trigger extensive shifts in the ranges of indigenous birds in this region, or that a priori assumptions are incorrect. Either way, this study highlights the danger of nave attribution of range changes to climate change, even if those range changes accord with the predictions of climate-change models. Nonetheless, studies of artificially enriched faunas, such as that of the Cape Peninsula, and the dynamics of these observed range shifts, may provide insight into processes likely to take place should climate change trigger significant poleward movement by Southern Hemisphere birds. },

One of the basic components, termed the functional response, was a response of the consumption of prey by individual predators to changes of prey density, and it appeared to be at least theoretically important in population regulation: Because of this importance the functional response has been further examined in an attempt to explain its characteristics.},

Just how popular is significance testing in psychology? This issue is examined in the present historical study, which uses data from randomly selected issues of the Journal of Applied Psychology for the period 1917-94. Results indicate that the practice of significance testing, at one time of restricted usage, has expanded to the point that it is virtually synonymous with empirical analysis. The data also lend support to Gigerenzer and Murray{'}s (1987) allegation that an inference revolution occurred in psychology during the period 1940-55. Unfortunately, it is concluded that the ubiquity of significance testing constitutes a classic example of the overadoption of a methodology.},

It was of interest to discover textbook coverage of the P-value (i.e., Fisher) and fixed-alpha (i.e., Neyman-Pearson) approaches to statistical testing. Also of interest in the review were some issues and concerns related to the practice and teaching of statistical testing: (a) levels of significance, (b) importance of effects, (c) statistical power and sample size, and (d) multiple testing. It is concluded that it is not statistical testing itself that is at fault; rather, some of the textbook presentation, teaching practices, and journal editorial reviewing may be questioned.},

  Abstract                 = {Declining population numbers coupled with the growing evidence of global change have focussed attention on the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) Received in revised form endemic to South Africa. The aim of this study is to develop a habitat model to aid in the identification of isolated populations, offer opportunities for re-introduction or intro duction, and guide future conservation efforts by assessing the possible impacts of global change. We attempt a novel approach where plant species which afford the riverine rabbit cover from predation and its primary food sources are modelled utilising the same tech: nique and are included as a predictor variable in the habitat model for both current and future projections of potential habitat. Inclusion of this proximal variable as well as ripar ian areas yields a more parsimonious habitat model than using climatic variables alone. Results suggest that unsurveyed suitable habitat east of Victoria West might harbour pre viously overlooked isolated populations or offer new opportunities for re-introductions. Conservation Future climatic conditions under the most severe general circulation model for the region (HADCM3) suggest that, on average, in excess of 96% of the current habitat could become unsuitable, mitigated only slightly by a possible 7% increase in range in adjacent upper catchment areas. Consideration of existing land transformation increases this range reduction by a further 1%. Given that ex situ captive breeding programmes have met with no success and that the bulk of future potential range lies well outside of the currently known and surveyed areas the current adaptation options of conservancy establishment and captive breeding need to be re-evaluated. Without positive human intervention the future of the critically endangered riverine rabbit under conditions of global change seems certain. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. },

  Abstract                 = {Given a choice between habitats differing only in food availability, prey are known to select the habitat providing the highest energetic return. They do so in a frequency-dependent manner, accounting for the reduction in food availability caused by the presence of other individuals; this results in the well-known {`}Ideal Free Distribution{'}, an equilibrium solution to a spatial game. When habitats also differ in predation risk due, for example, to different predator densities, prey also appear able to take this into account. However, in most theory (and most experiments) the predation risk levels in the available habitats are assumed to be fixed. Here we ask what will happen if predators are able to adjust their distribution in response to the habitat choice decisions of their prey, i.e. we model a generalized habitat selection game between predators and prey. We first develop a basic model which captures the essence of the problem, and then expand it to include risk dilution and interference among predators. The model produces several new insights, notably that, in the absence of interference effects, the density of prey in a habitat is determined solely by the inherent {`}riskiness{'} of that habitat (a habitat measure independent of predator density, which might reflect cover or light levels, for example) and is unaffected by habitat productivity (a measure of the food resource available to the prey). When interference exists between predators, prey density is also determined by habitat productivity but to a lesser extent than by riskiness. Consequently, prey may not respond significantly to changes in relative food resource availability among habitats if their predators are also free to choose the habitat which maximizes their expected fitness. We consider briefly the potential applications of game theory to diel vertical migration and other fish predator-prey scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {In ecological modeling the interaction between a predator and its prey, is usually implemented as a linear or saturated function of the prey density. The main advantages of such a {`}{'}functional response{''} are its simplicity, general applicability, and well understood mechanistic basis. In systems where predators compete directly for the available prey however, the functional response should depend not only on the prey density but also on the predator density. We aim here to devise a simple and generic {`}{'}predator-dependent{''} functional response. We derive such a functional response by making quasi-steady-state assumptions for models, in which we allow predators and prey to form interaction complexes. We end up with the - previously proposed - {`}{'}Beddington{''} functional response. Because of our formal derivation this simple predator-dependent functional response is now based on clear mechanistic reasoning. The direct predator interference of this functional response emerges from the interaction between a predator and a prey, and not from direct predator-predator interactions. We conclude however that, although the Beddington functional response is generic for a two-dimensional system of one prey interacting with one predator, it is difficult to generalize it to higher dimensional systems consisting of several prey and predator species.

It covers principal component analysis (PCA) when variables are quantitative, correspondence analysis (CA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) when variables are categorical, and hierarchical cluster analysis. The authors take a geometric point of view that provides a unified vision for exploring multivariate data tables. Within this framework, they present the principles, indicators, and ways of representing and visualizing objects that are common to the exploratory methods. The authors show how to use categorical variables in a PCA context in which variables are quantitative, how to handle more than two categorical variables in a CA context in which there are originally two variables, and how to add quantitative variables in an MCA context in which variables are categorical. They also illustrate the methods and the ways they can be exploited using examples from various fields. Throughout the text, each result correlates with an R command accessible in the FactoMineR package developed by the authors. All of the data sets and code are available at http://factominer.free.fr/book.

  Abstract                 = {This book is very different from any other publication in the field and it is unique because of its focus on the practical implementation of the simulation and estimation methods presented. The book should be useful to practitioners and students with minimal mathematical background, but because of the many R programs, probably also to many mathematically well educated practitioners. Many of the methods presented in the book have, so far, not been used much in practice because the lack of an implementation in a unified framework. This book fills the gap. With the R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for practitioners and students. An R package called {`}sde{'} provides functionswith easy interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from real life applications. Although it contains a wide range of results, the book has an introductory character and necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of simulation and inference for general stochastic differential equations. The book is organized in four chapters. The first one introduces the subject and presents several classes of processes used in many fields of mathematics, computational biology, finance and the social sciences. The second chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new methods not available in other milestones publication known so far. The third one is focused on parametric estimation techniques. In particular, it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions, generalized method of moments and other techniques. The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like nonparametric estimation, model identification and change point estimation. The reader non-expert in R language, will find a concise introduction to this environment focused on the subject of the book which should allow for instant use of the proposed material. To each R functions presented in the book a documentation page is available at the end of the book.},

Eratyrus), and one genus from the Rhodniini (represented by one non-native species Rhodnius prolixus, formerly occurring exclusively in domestic habitats); 28 species are found exclusively in Mexico (and/or Central America), eight are shared between the United States (US) and Mexico, and four occur exclusively in the US. The genus Triatoma is the most diverse with 26 species belonging to the species groups protracta, including the species complexes protracta and lecticularia, and rubrofasciata, which includes the species complexes rubida, phyllosoma and dimidiata. Triatomine species richness declined both at higher (south US) and lower (south of the Istmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico) latitudes. Triatoma species are found predominantly in cropland, grassland, wooded grassland and woodland landscapes. Land cover types were most similar among the lecticularia, protracta, and rubida complexes, in contrast to the phyllosoma and dimidiata species complexes. The land cover types having highest suitability for most species were wooded grassland, followed by woodland for the phyllosoma and dimidiata species complexes, and open and closed shrubland and cropland for the remaining three species complexes. A principal component analysis was used to demonstrate differences in the potential range for use of environmental conditions: protracta and phyllosoma complexes occupy the broadest niches. The present study represents a primary stratification of potential triatomine dispersal areas, based on species and species complexes, and based on predicted niche, a method which has already proven to be highly significant epidemiologically.

  Abstract                 = {Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu have been introduced into freshwater habitats in Japan, with potentially serious consequences for native fish populations. In this paper we apply the technique of ecological niche modeling using the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) to predict the potential distributions of these two species in Japan. This algorithm constructs a niche model based on point occurrence records and ecological coverages. The model can be visualized in geographic space, yielding a prediction of potential geographic range. The model can then be tested by determining how well independent point occurrence data are predicted according to the criteria of sensitivity and specificity provided by receiver-operator curve analysis. We ground-truthed GARP{'}s ability to forecast the geographic occurrence of each species in its native range. The predictions were statistically significant for both species (P \textless 0.001). We projected the niche models onto the Japanese landscape to visualize the potential geographic ranges of both species in Japan. We tested these predictions using known occurrences from introduced populations of largemouth bass, both in the aggregate and by habitat type. All analyses robustly predicted known Japanese occurrences (P \textless 0.001). The number of smallmouth bass in Japan was too small for statistical tests, but the 10 known occurrences were predicted by the majority of models.},

To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modeling (ENM) based on detailed distributional information recently gathered, in relation to detailed climatic data sets. The ENMs successfully reconstructed key features of the species{'} geographic distribution, focusing almost entirely on the southern WG. Much of the species{'} distributional potential is already under protection, but our analysis allows identification of key zones for additional protection, all of which are adjacent to existing protected areas. ENM provides a useful tool for understanding the natural history of such rare and endangered species.},

  Abstract                 = {We are using a deterministic regression tree analysis model (DISTRIB) and a stochastic migration model (SHIFT) to examine potential distributions of similar to 66 individual species of eastern US trees under a 2 x CO2 climate change scenario. This process is demonstrated for Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data for more than 100 000 plots and nearly 3 million trees east of the 100th meridian were analyzed and aggregated to the county level to provide species importance values for each of more than 2100 counties. County-level data also were compiled on climate, soils, land use, elevation, and spatial pattern. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution and predict the potential future distributions under two scenarios of climate change (2 x CO2). RTA allows different variables to control importance value predictions at different regions, e.g. at the northern versus southern range limits of a species. RTA outputs represent the potential {'}environmental envelope{'} shifts required by species, while the migration model predicts the more realistic shifts based on colonization probabilities from varying species abundances within a fragmented landscape. The model shows severely limited migration in regions of high forest fragmentation, particularly when the species is low in abundance near the range boundary. These tools are providing mechanisms for evaluating the relationships among various environmental and landscape factors associated with tree-species importance and potential migration in a changing global climate.

However, we cannot afford to wait for complete information on the distribution and abundance of native and harmful invasive species. Using information from counties well surveyed for plants across the USA, we developed models to fill data gaps in poorly surveyed areas by estimating the density (number of species km(-2)) of native and non-native plant species. Here, we show that native plant species density is non-random, predictable, and is the best predictor of non-native plant species density. We found that eastern agricultural sites and coastal areas are among the most invaded in terms of non-native plant species densities, and that the central USA appears to have the greatest ratio of non-native to native species. These large-scale models could also be applied to smaller spatial scales or other taxa to set priorities for conservation and invasion mitigation, prevention, and control efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator{'}s hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation. The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited. The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.},

  Abstract                 = {Bioclimatic models (also known as envelope models or, more broadly, ecological niche models or species distribution models) are used to predict geographic ranges of organisms as a function of climate. They are widely used to forecast range shifts of organisms due to climate change, predict the eventual ranges of invasive species, infer paleoclimate from data on species occurrences, and so forth. Several statistical techniques (including general linear models, general additive models, climate envelope models, classification and regression trees, and genetic algorithms) have been used in bioclimatic modeling. Recently developed techniques tend to perform better than older techniques, although it is unlikely that any single statistical approach will be optimal for all applications and species. Proponents of bioclimatic models have stressed their apparent predictive power, whereas opponents have identified the following unreasonable model assumptions: biotic interactions are unimportant in determining geographic ranges or are constant over space and time; the genetic and phenotypic composition of species is constant over space and time; and species are unlimited in their dispersal. In spite of these problematic assumptions, bioclimatic models often successfully fit present-day ranges of species. Their ability to forecast the effects of climate change or the spread of invaders has rarely been tested adequately, however, and we urge researchers to tie the evaluation of bioclimatic models more closely to their intended uses.},

Existing species occurrence data are biased towards some taxonomic groups (especially vertebrates), and are more complete for Europe and North America than for the rest of the world. We outline a procedure for development of such biodiversity scenarios using available data on species distribution derived from primary biodiversity data and habitat conditions, and analytical software, which allows estimation of species{'} distributions, and forecasting of likely effects of various agents of change on the distribution and status of the same species. Such approaches can translate into improved knowledge for countries regarding the 2010 Biodiversity Target of reducing significantly the rate of biodiversity loss-indeed, using methodologies such as those illustrated herein, many countries should be capable of analyzing trends of change for at least part of their biodiversity. Sources of errors that are present in primary biodiversity data and that can affect projections are discussed. },

A recent Special Feature in Ecology advocated nonparametric methods because of an erroneously stated advantage that they require no assumptions regarding the distribution underlying the observations. The present paper points out some often-ignored features of nonparametric tests comparing two means, and advocates parameter estimation as a preferred alternative to hypothesis testing in many situations.},

  Abstract                 = {Consumption of a resource by an organism is a key process in both microbiology and population ecology. Recently, there has been a debate in population ecology about the importance of organism density in functions describing this process. Actually, microbiologists hale had this debate over the last 40 years. In reviewing their main results I show that even for the most simple systems there is no unique correct function to describe consumption. Organism density influences consumption to various degrees. I conclude that, for predictions based on model simulation, one should use a pluralistic approach, working with different models to identify robust predictions (that is, common to all studied models) and guide further research to understand model-specific predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {The functional response is a key element in predator-prey models as well as in food chains and food webs. Classical models consider it as a function of prey abundance only. However, many mechanisms can lead to predator dependence, and there is increasing evidence for the importance of this dependence. Identification of the mathematical form of the functional response from real data is therefore a challenging task. In this paper we apply model-fitting to test if typical ecological predator-prey time series data, which contain both observation error and process error, can give some information about the form of the functional response. Working with artificial data (for which the functional response is known) we will show that with moderate noise levels, identification of the model that generated the data is possible. However, the noise levels prevailing in real ecological time-series can give rise to wrong identifications. We will also discuss the quality of parameter estimation by fitting differential equations to such time-series. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of a species is determined by a set of ecological correlates (biotic and abiotic factors) and historical phenomena that define and constrain its ecological niche. By examining the geographical projection of the ecological niche, it is possible to identify areas that are suitable for the species ecologically but that are not actually inhabited. Previous studies have used such discords to anticipate the existence of undescribed species; the absence of species may also result from historical barriers that have prevented colonization of the area. Thus, discords between potential and realized niches of a species may result from aspects of the species{'}s biology (e.g. lack of dispersal ability, specific habitat requirements) or from barriers to dispersal. In this study, we developed ecological niche models of the five Nearctic species of wood-feeding cockroaches in the genus Cryptocercus. One species, C. clevelandi, occurs in the western USA and four (C. darwini, C. garciai, C. punctulatus, C. wrighti) are distributed in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern USA. In general, modelled niches for all species showed ecological restriction relative to the total range of available conditions. Niche models for the eastern USA species predicted the geographical distributions of the other eastern USA species, with the exception of C. garciai, suggesting general overall conservatism in ecological characteristics. Some interspecific differences in modelled niches were also apparent. In general, C. clevelandi was predicted to occupy cooler and drier areas relative to the eastern USA species; among the eastern USA species, C. darwini and C. garciai were predicted to inhabit warmer areas relative to C. punctulatus and C. wrighti. Interspecific differences and similarities were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among Cryptocercus species previously reported. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.},

  Abstract                 = {Smoothing methods have been little used within the social sciences. Semiparametric Regression for the Social Sciences sets out to address this situation by providing an accessible introduction to the subject, filled with examples drawn from the social and political sciences. Readers are introduced to the principles of nonparametric smoothing and to a wide variety of smoothing methods. The author also explains how smoothing methods can be incorporated into parametric linear and generalized linear models. The use of smoothers with these standard statistical models allows the estimation of more flexible functional forms whilst retaining the interpretability of parametric models. The full potential of these techniques is highlighted via the use of detailed empirical examples drawn from the social and political sciences. Each chapter features exercises to aid in the understanding of the methods and applications. All examples in the book were estimated in R. The book contains an appendix with R commands to introduce readers to estimating these models in R. All the R code for the examples in the book are available from the author{'}s website and the publishers website.},

  Abstract                 = {Opinions differ on the empirical success of the Ideal Free Distribution. The Ideal Free model predicts that the distribution of organisms between resource sites should match the distribution of resources. Many studies report support for this prediction. We review tests of this model utilising a method of analysis derived from the psychological principle called the matching law. Our reanalysis revealed that the distribution of organisms is consistently less extreme than the distribution of resources. This systematic deviation from the Ideal Free Distribution means organisms underuse richer sites and overuse poorer sites. We examine how deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution may arise as a consequence of discrimination constraints, competitive interactions, competitive asymmetries and travel between sites, and recommend ways in which the design of future tests of the Ideal Free Distribution may be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {Atmospheric CO2 has more than doubled since the last glacial maximum (LGM) and could double again within this century, largely due to anthropogenic activity. It has been suggested that low [CO2] contributed to reduced tree cover in savanna and grassland biomes at LGM, and that increasing [CO2] over the last century promoted increases in woody plants in these ecosystems over the past few decades. Despite the implications of this idea for understanding global carbon cycle dynamics and key global role of the savanna biome, there are still very few experimental studies quantifying the effects of CO2 on tree growth and demography in savannas and grasslands. In this paper we present photosynthetic, growth and carbon allocation responses of African savanna trees (Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica) and a C-4 grass, Themeda triandra, exposed to a gradient of CO2 concentrations from 180 (typical of LGM) to 1000 mu mol mol-1 in open-top chambers in a glasshouse as a first empirical test of this idea. Photosynthesis, total stem length, total stem diameter, shoot dry weight and root dry weight of the acacias increased significantly across the CO2 gradient, saturating at higher CO2 concentrations. After clipping to simulate fire, plants showed an even greater response in total stem length, total stem diameter and shoot dry weight, signalling the importance of re-sprouting following disturbances such as fire or herbivory in savanna systems. Root starch (per unit root mass and total root starch per plant) increased steeply along the CO2 gradient, explaining the re-sprouting response. In contrast to the strong response of tree seedlings to the CO2 gradient, grass productivity showed little variation, even at low CO2 concentrations. These results suggest that CO2 has significant direct effects on tree recruitment in grassy ecosystems, influencing the ability of trees to recover from fire damage and herbivory. Fire and herbivore regimes that were effective in controlling tree increases in grassy ecosystems could thus be much less effective in a CO2-rich world, but field-based tests are needed to confirm this suggestion. },

  Abstract                 = {Endemism and species richness are highly relevant to the global prioritization of conservation efforts in which oceanic islands have remained relatively neglected. When compared to mainland areas, oceanic islands in general are known for their high percentage of endemic species but only moderate levels of species richness, prompting the question of their relative conservation value. Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness ("endemism richness") of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims We present the first global map of vascular plant species richness by ecoregion and compare these results with the published literature on global priorities for plant conservation. In so doing, we assess the state of floristic knowledge across ecoregions as described in floras, checklists, and other published documents and pinpoint geographical gaps in our understanding of the global vascular plant flora. Finally, we explore the relationships between plant species richness by ecoregion and our knowledge of the flora, and between plant richness and the human footprint - a spatially explicit measure of the loss and degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems as a result of human activities. Location Global. Methods Richness estimates for the 867 terrestrial ecoregions of the world were derived from published richness data of c. 1800 geographical units. We applied one of four methods to assess richness, depending on data quality. These included collation and interpretation of published data, use of species-area curves to extrapolate richness, use of taxon-based data, and estimates derived from other ecoregions within the same biome. Results The highest estimate of plant species richness is in the Borneo lowlands ecoregion (10,000 species) followed by nine ecoregions located in Central and South America with \textgreater= 8000 species; all are found within the Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome. Among the 51 ecoregions with \textgreater= 5000 species, only five are located in temperate regions. For 43% of the 867 ecoregions, data quality was considered good or moderate. Among biomes, adequate data are especially lacking for flooded grasslands and flooded savannas. We found a significant correlation between species richness and data quality for only a few biomes, and, in all of these cases, our results indicated that species-rich ecoregions are better studied than those poor in vascular plants. Similarly, only in a few biomes did we find significant correlations between species richness and the human footprint, all of which were positive. Main conclusions The work presented here sets the stage for comparisons of degree of concordance of plant species richness with plant endemism and vertebrate species richness: important analyses for a comprehensive global biodiversity strategy. We suggest: (1) that current global plant conservation strategies be reviewed to check if they cover the most outstanding examples of regions from each of the world{'}s major biomes, even if these examples are species-poor compared with other biomes; (2) that flooded grasslands and flooded savannas should become a global priority in collecting and compiling richness data for vascular plants; and (3) that future studies which rely upon species-area calculations do not use a uniform parameter value but instead use values derived separately for subregions.},

  Abstract                 = {This is the first book on applied econometrics using the R system for statistical computing and graphics. It presents hands-on examples for a wide range of econometric models, from classical linear regression models for cross-section, time series or panel data and the common non-linear models of microeconometrics such as logit, probit and tobit models, to recent semiparametric extensions. In addition, it provides a chapter on programming, including simulations, optimization, and an introduction to R tools enabling reproducible econometric research. An R package accompanying this book, AER, is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER. It contains some 100 data sets taken from a wide variety of sources, the full source code for all examples used in the text plus further worked examples, e.g., from popular textbooks. The data sets are suitable for illustrating, among other things, the fitting of wage equations, growth regressions, hedonic regressions, dynamic regressions and time series models as well as models of labor force participation or the demand for health care. The goal of this book is to provide a guide to R for users with a background in economics or the social sciences. Readers are assumed to have a background in basic statistics and econometrics at the undergraduate level. A large number of examples should make the book of interest to graduate students, researchers and practitioners alike. },

  Abstract                 = {R is now the most widely used statistical software in academic science and it is rapidly expanding into other fields such as finance. R is almost limitlessly flexible and powerful, hence its appeal, but can be very difficult for the novice user. There are no easy pull-down menus, error messages are often cryptic and simple tasks like importing your data or exporting a graph can be difficult and frustrating. Introductory R is written for the novice user who knows a bit about statistics but who hasn{'}t yet got to grips with the ways of R. This book: walks you through the basics of R{'}s command line interface; gives a set of simple rules to follow to make sure you import your data properly; introduces the script editor and gives advice on workflow; contains a detailed introduction to drawing graphs in R and gives advice on how to deal with some of the most common errors that you might encounter. The techniques of statistical analysis in R are illustrated by a series of chapters where experimental and survey data are analysed. There is a strong emphasis on using real data from real scientific research, with all the problems and uncertainty that implies, rather than well-behaved made-up data that give ideal and easy to analyse results.},

  Abstract                 = {Meta-analysis has increasingly been used as an explanatory research tool. The present investigation was designed to illustrate the potential limitations of meta-analysis for making causal inferences. Several meta-analytic investigations have led others to conclude that gender differences are getting smaller over time, however, there has been little concern regarding changes in research methodology over time. The present findings indicate that the gender differences in aggression appear to be remarkably stable when changes in study characteristics over time are controlled. The authors discuss the implications for the use of meta-analytic procedures to make causal inferences and the implications for understanding the causes of gender differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological limit functions relating streamflow and aquatic ecosystems remain elusive despite decades of research. We investigated functional relationships between species richness and changes in streamflow characteristics at 662 fish sampling sites in the Tennessee River basin. Our approach included the following: (1) a brief summary of relevant literature on functional relations between fish and streamflow, (2) the development of ecological limit functions that describe the strongest discernible relationships between fish species richness and streamflow characteristics, (3) the evaluation of proposed definitions of hydrologic reference conditions, and (4) an investigation of the internal structures of wedge-shaped distributions underlying ecological limit functions. Twenty-one ecological limit functions were developed across three ecoregions that relate the species richness of 11 fish groups and departures from hydrologic reference conditions using multivariate and quantile regression methods. Each negatively sloped function is described using up to four streamflow characteristics expressed in terms of cumulative departure from hydrologic reference conditions. Negative slopes indicate increased departure results in decreased species richness. Sites with the highest measured fish species richness generally had near-reference hydrologic conditions for a given ecoregion. Hydrology did not generally differ between sites with the highest and lowest fish species richness, indicating that other environmental factors likely limit species richness at sites with reference hydrology. Use of ecological limit functions to make decisions regarding proposed hydrologic regime changes, although commonly presented as a management tool, is not as straightforward or informative as often assumed. We contend that statistical evaluation of the internal wedge structure below limit functions may provide a probabilistic understanding of how aquatic ecology is influenced by altered hydrology and may serve as the basis for evaluating the potential effect of proposed hydrologic changes.

The pooled mean yearly breeding density varied from 0.1 to 2.4 pairs/km2. The number of nesting EKs (range 2-46 pairs), SOs (0-49), and LOs (0-19) fluctuated in close accordance with the spring density of Microtus (M. agrestis and M. epiroticus) voles. The mean yearly number of fledglings produced per pair ranged from 0.4 to 3.8 and, for each species, was positively correlated with spring density of Microtus voles. Due to their high degree of mobility, EKs, SOs, and LOs were able to track the population fluctuations of their microtine prey without time lags. An increase in microtine densities caused a rapid immigration into the study area and a decrease caused a rapid emigration from the area. Microtus voles were the most important prey group by mass in the diet of each species. Water voles, bank voles, shrews, and small birds were the most frequent alternate prey. The spring density of Microtus spp. was positively correlated with the percentage of these voles in the diet of EK, SO, and LO. The pooled functional response curve of these three raptor species to the fluctuating densities of Microtus spp. was close to linear, indicating that consumption rates are independent of vole densities. Breeding EKs, SOs, and LOs seemed to take a larger proportion of voles available in peak years than in low ones.},

  Abstract                 = {Plants, with an estimated 300,000 species, provide crucial primary production and ecosystem structure. To date, our quantitative understanding of diversity gradients of megadiverse clades such as plants has been hampered by the paucity of distribution data. Here, we investigate the global-scale species-richness pattern of vascular plants and examine its environmental and potential historical determinants. Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness. After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor model explains approximately 70% of the global variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act synergistically with water-energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

  Abstract                 = {The pervasive influence of island biogeography theory on forest fragmentation research has often led to a misleading conceptualization of landscapes as areas of forest/habitat and {'}non-forest/non-habitat{'} and an overriding focus on processes within forest remnants at the expense of research in the human-modified matrix. The matrix, however, may be neither uniformly unsuitable as habitat nor serve as a fully-absorbing barrier to the dispersal of forest taxa. In this paper, we present a conceptual model that addresses how forest habitat loss and fragmentation affect biodiversity through reduction of the resource base, subdivision of populations, alterations of species interactions and disturbance regimes, modifications of microclimate and increases in the presence of invasive species and human pressures on remnants. While we acknowledge the importance of changes associated with the forest remnants themselves (e.g. decreased forest area and increased isolation of forest patches), we stress that the extent, intensity and permanence of alterations to the matrix will have an overriding influence on area and isolation effects and emphasize the potential roles of the matrix as not only a barrier but also as habitat, source and conduit. Our intention is to argue for shifting the examination of forest fragmentation effects away from a patch-based perspective focused on factors such as patch area and distance metrics to a landscape mosaic perspective that recognizes the importance of gradients in habitat conditions.},

This book-developed and published in association with the International Biogeography Society (www.biogeography.org)- concentrates explicitly on these advances and on the most promising and most insightful lines of future research on the geography of nature.

  Abstract                 = {One of the fundamental dimensions of biodiversity is the rate of species turnover across geographic distance. The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa has exceptionally high geographic species turnover, much of which is associated with groups of closely related species with mostly or completely non-overlapping distributions. A basic unresolved question about biodiversity in this global hotspot is the relative importance of ecological gradients in generating and maintaining high geographic turnover in the region. We used reciprocal transplant experiments to test the extent to which abiotic environmental factors may limit the distributions of a group of closely related species in the genus Protea (Proteaceae), and thus elevate species turnover in this diverse, iconic family. We tested whether these species have a "home site advantage" in demographic rates (germination, growth, mortality), and also parameterized stage-structured demographic models for the species. Two of the three native species were predicted to have a demographic advantage at their home sites. The models also predicted, however, that species could maintain positive population growth rates at sites beyond their current distribution limits. Thus the experiment suggests that abiotic limitation under current environmental conditions does not fully explain the observed distribution limits or resulting biogeographic pattern. One potentially important mechanism is dispersal limitation, which is consistent with estimates based on genetic data and mechanistic dispersal models, though other mechanisms including competition may also play a role. },

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed successional patterns in a very dry tropical deciduous forest by using 15 plots differing in age after abandonment and contrasted them to secondary successions elsewhere in the tropics. We used multivariate ordination and nonlinear models to examine changes in composition and structure and to estimate forest recovery rates and resilience. A shrub phase characterized early succession (0-3 yr); afterwards, the tree Mimosa acantholoba became dominant. Below its canopy, sprouts and seed-regenerated individuals of mature forest species slowly accumulated. Canopy height, plant density, and crown cover stabilized in less than 15 yr, whereas species richness, diversity, and basal area continued to increase. The pioneer species group has very low diversity and the long-lived pioneer phase typical of humid forests is absent; species composition may therefore recover soon as suggested by convergence toward mature forest species composition. The time trend of plant density also differed from humid forests for it lacked its characteristic density decline, presumably because of differences in regeneration mechanisms between very dry and other less water-stressed forest types. As opposed to the prevailing hypothesis, resilience was not higher than in moister forests, and thus factors other than structure relative simplicity must be accounted for when assessing resilience. },

  Abstract                 = {1. Little consensus has been reached as to general features of spatial variation in beta diversity, a fundamental component of species diversity. This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult. 2. We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties. 3. Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between {'}broad sense{'} measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and {'}narrow sense{'} measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable. 4. We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted a , b and c) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of the Anopheles gambiae complex of malaria vectors in Africa is uncertain due to under-sampling of vast regions. We use ecologic niche modeling to predict the potential distribution of three members of the complex (A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. quadriannulatus) and demonstrate the statistical significance of the models. Predictions correspond well to previous estimates, but provide detail regarding spatial discontinuities in the distribution of A. gambiae s.s. that are consistent with population genetic studies. Our predictions also identify large areas of Africa where the presence of A. arabiensis is predicted, but few specimens have been obtained, suggesting under-sampling of the species. Finally, we project models developed from African distribution data for the late 1900s into the past and to South America to determine retrospectively whether the deadly 1929 introduction of A. gambiae sensu lato into Brazil was more likely that of A. gambiae sensu stricto or A. arabiensis.},

Monkeypox virus is thought to be endemic to forested areas of western and Central Africa. Considerably more is known about human monkeypox disease occurrence than about natural sylvatic cycles of this virus in non-human animal hosts. We use human monkeypox case data from Africa for 1970-2003 in an ecological niche modeling framework to construct predictive models of the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of monkeypox virus across West and Central Africa. Tests of internal predictive ability using different subsets of input data show the model to be highly robust and suggest that the distinct phylogenetic lineages of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa occupy similar ecological niches. High mean annual precipitation and low elevations were shown to be highly correlated with human monkeypox disease occurrence. The synthetic picture of the potential geographic distribution of human monkeypox in Africa resulting from this study should support ongoing epidemiologic and ecological studies, as well as help to guide public health intervention strategies to areas at highest risk for human monkeypox.},

GARP{'}s efficiency has been demonstrated to be robust even with incomplete occurrence and geographic data. Thorough biological sampling in conjunction with comprehensive geographic information, however, is not the norm for many tropical areas where most biodiversity occurs. Mammals from Guyana were used as a test of the robustness of these approaches in a worst-case scenario of uneven sampling combined with coarse geographic data. The occurrence of species in poorly surveyed regions, such as the Pakaraima Highlands of west-central Guyana, was consistently under-predicted, whereas presence in well-surveyed areas such as the southwestern Rupununi was usually correctly predicted. Comparisons of numbers of species and specimens collected also indicate that lowland forests in the southeast and coastal forests in the northwest are under-sampled. For robust distributional predictions in Guyana, more thorough inventories are needed in these diverse environments.},

  Abstract                 = {The management of landscapes for biological conservation and ecologically sustainable natural resource use are crucial global issues. Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.},

  Abstract                 = {The management of landscapes for biological conservation and ecologically sustainable natural resource use are crucial global issues. Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.},

  Abstract                 = {Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management "shortcuts" such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management "natural experiments" and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.

  Abstract                 = {Different sources of information about biodiversity may lead to unrealistic or biased estimation of its components, with different patterns according to the scale of analysis. In this study, we analyse patterns of species richness at the local (average alpha) and regional (gamma) scales, and the relationship between them (Whittaker{'}s beta), in central Mexico, using as a source of data for the species{'} distributions: (1) museum specimen occurrence data for birds, and (2) distribution maps based on ecological niche models developed and refined by experts. We performed analyses at five spatial resolutions (1/32 degrees-1/2 degrees). Scale changes (grain and extent) affected significantly the estimates of average alpha, gamma, and beta. Use of raw occurrence data vs. distribution maps yielded contrasting results, with raw data underestimating alpha and overestimating beta, as functions of area. As regards species-area relationships, our results suggest a natural decomposition of factors into an area-invariant component (related to alpha), and an area dependent factor (related to beta). Most of our results are maintained in a null model that randomizes occurrences without changing observed range-size distributions. From this result we argue that average alpha and Whittaker{'}s beta capture little information about the spatial covariation of species distribution patterns.},

Even though there are many approaches to determining thresholds, there is no comparative study. In this paper, twelve approaches were compared using two species in Europe and artificial neural networks, and the modelling results were assessed using four indices: sensitivity, specificity, overall prediction success and Cohen{'}s kappa statistic. The results show that prevalence approach, average predicted probability/suitability approach, and three sensitivity-specificity-combined approaches, including sensitivity-specificity sum maximization approach, sensitivity-specificity equality approach and the approach based on the shortest distance to the top-left corner (0,1) in ROC plot, are the good ones. The commonly used kappa maximization approach is not as good as the afore-mentioned ones, and the fixed threshold approach is the worst one. We also recommend using datasets with prevalence of 50% to build models if possible since most optimization criteria might be satisfied or nearly satisfied at the same time, and therefore it{'}s easier to find optimal thresholds in this situation.},

  Abstract                 = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability derived scores are converted to a binary presence-absence variable, by summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

  Abstract                 = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject x condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor (square root 2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most daunting challenges for Chagas disease surveillance and control in Mexico is the lack of community level data on vector distributions. Although many states now have assembled representative domestic triatomine collections, only two triatomine specimens bad been collected and reported previously from the state of Guanajuato. Field personnel from the state{'}s Secretaria de Salud conducted health promotion activities in 43 of the 46 counties in the state and received donations of a total of 2,522 triatomine specimens between 1998 and 2002. All specimens were identified, and live insects examined for Trypanosoma cruzi. In an effort to develop fine-scale distributional data for Guanajuato, collection localities were georeferenced and ecological niches were modeled for each species by using evolutionary-computing approaches. Five species were collected: Triatoma mexicana (Herrich-Schaeffer), Triatoma longipennis (Usinger), Triatoma pallidipennis (Stal), Triatoma barberi (Usinger), and Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille) from 201 communities located at elevations of 870 - 2,200 m. Based on collection success, T mexicana had the broadest dispersion, although niche mapping indicates that T barberi represents the greatest risk for transmission of Chagas disease in the state. T dimidiata was represented in collections by a single adult collected from one village outside the predicted area for all species. For humans, In estimated 3,755,380 individuals are at risk for vector transmission in the state, with an incidence of 3,500 new cases per year; overall seroprevalences of 2.6% indicate that 97,640 individuals are infected with T cruzi at present, including 29,300 chronic cases.},

Authored by the team that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book provides a practical introduction to this program and its use. The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked examples and a wide range of applications from various disciplines. The book introduces regression models, techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide range of modelling issues before going into the vital area of hierarchical models, one of the most common applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions{--}-all those aspects of the {``}art{''} of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions. More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of {``}tricks{''} that reveal the real power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas. Full code and data for examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found on the book{'}s website.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim To enhance current attempts to understand biodiversity patterns by using an historical ecology approach to highlight the over-riding influence of land-use history in creating past, current and future patterns of biodiversity in fragmented agricultural landscapes. Methods We develop an integrative conceptual framework for understanding spatial and temporal variations in landscape patterns in fragmented agricultural landscapes by presenting five postulates (hypotheses) which highlight the important role of historical, anthropogenic disturbance regimes. We then illustrate each of these postulates with examples drawn from fragmented woodlands in agricultural areas of south-eastern Australia, and discuss these findings in an international context. Location examples are drawn from agricultural areas in south-eastern Australia. Results We conclude that there is limited potential to refine our understanding of patterns of biodiversity in human-modified landscapes based on traditional concepts of island biogeography, or simple assumptions of ongoing destruction and degradation. Instead, we propose that in agricultural landscapes that were largely cleared over a century ago: (1) present-day remnant vegetation patterns are not accidental, but are logically arrayed due to historic land-use decisions, (2) historic anthropogenic disturbances have a major influence on current ecosystem conditions and diversity patterns, and (3) the condition of remnant ecosystems is not necessarily deteriorating rapidly. Main conclusions An historical ecology approach can enhance our understanding of why different species and ecosystem states occur where they do, and can explain internal variations in ecological conditions within remnant ecosystems, too often casually attributed to the {'}mess of history{'}. This framework emphasizes temporal changes (both past and future) in biotic patterns and processes in fragmented agricultural landscapes. Integration of spatially and temporally explicit historical land-use information into ecological studies can prove extremely useful to test hypotheses of the effects of changes in landscape processes, and to enhance future research, restoration and conservation management activities.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that a Fisherian approach to statistical inference, which views statistical testing as determining the chance probability of an event, is coherent, consistent with modern statistical methods and forms a sound theoretical basis for the use of statistical tests in psychology. It is argued that Fisherian statistical tests are concerned with establishing the direction of tested effects, give rise to confidence intervals and are quite consistent with power analyses. Researchers are encouraged to report chance probabilities, and to interpret them according to the prevailing conditions rather than using a fixed decision rule. The contrasting Neyman-Pearson approach, which Views statistical testing as a quality control procedure for accepting hypotheses, posits unreasonable research practices which psychologists do not and should not be expected to follow. Neyman-Pearson theory has caused confusion in the psychological literature and criticisms have been levelled at statistical testing in general that ought to have been directed specifically at Neyman-Pearson testing. Statistical inference, of any sore, is held to be insufficient to characterize the process of testing scientific hypotheses. Data should be seen as evidence to be used in psychological arguments and statistical significance is just one measure of its quality. It restrains researchers from making too much of findings which could otherwise be explained by chance.},

  Abstract                 = {Rotifers and cladocerans are important components of most freshwater plankton communities. Large cladocerans can suppress rotifers through both mechanical interference competition (IC) and exploitative competition (EC) for shared food resources. We assessed the relative extent by which small- and large-bodied cladocerans suppressed the rotifer Keratella cochlearis by these mechanisms, using circulating algal suspensions in dual-chamber laboratory cultures and natural animal densities. The small-bodied cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia suppressed Keratella exclusively through EC, while a slightly larger species (Daphnia ambigua) did it primarily by this mechanism. Adults (Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulex) and subadults (Daphnia pulex) of two much larger bodied cladocerans suppressed Keratella primarily through IC. The ratio of initial Keratella to adult Daphnia pulex density had little effect on the relative importance of the mechanisms-IC always greatly exceeded EC. Suppression by EC occurred in all treatments only after food was depleted below the concentration necessary to support maximal rotifer population growth, while suppression by IC occurred at both high and low food concentrations. These two mechanisms by which cladocerans interact with rotifers should affect the composition of natural rotifer communities in markedly different ways; IC should favor invulnerable rotifer species, many of which are large bodied, while EC should favor rotifer species withlow food requirements, which tend to be small bodied.},

  Abstract                 = {Determination of the relative abundance of two populations, separated by time or space, is of interest in many ecological situations. We focus on two estimators of relative abundance, which assume that the probability that an individual is detected at least once in the survey is either equal or unequal for the two populations. We present three methods for incorporating the collected information into our inference. The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equivalence testing, is one approach to doing so. Third, we suggest that model averaging could be used by combining the two estimators according to derived model weights. These differing approaches are applied to a mark-recapture experiment on Nuttall{'}s cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus nuttallii) conducted in central Oregon during 1974 and 1975, which has been previously analyzed by other authors.},

  Abstract                 = {Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is established across western North America, and yet little is known of what determines the broad-scale dimensions of its overall range. We tested whether its North American distribution represents a composite of individual host plague associations (the "Host Niche Hypothesis"), or whether mammal hosts become infected only at sites overlapping ecological conditions appropriate for plague transmission and maintenance (the "Plague Niche Hypothesis"). We took advantage of a novel data set summarizing plague records in wild mammals newly digitized from paper-based records at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop range-wide tests of ecological niche similarity between mammal host niches and plague-infected host niches. Results indicate that plague infections occur under circumstances distinct from the broader ecological distribution of hosts, and that plague-infected niches are similar among hosts; hence, evidence coincides with the predictions of the Plague Niche Hypothesis, and contrasts with those of the Host Niche Hypothesis. The "plague niche" is likely driven by ecological requirements of vector flea species. },

Here, we test whether climate niches differ between native and introduced populations of Impatiens walleriana, globally one of the most popular horticultural species. We use approaches based on both raw climate data associated with occurrence points and ecological niche models (ENMs) developed with Maxent. We include comparisons of climate niche breadth in both geographic and environmental spaces, taking into account differences in available habitats between the distributional areas. We find significant differences in climate envelopes between native and introduced populations when comparing raw climate variables, with introduced populations appearing to expand into wetter and cooler climates. However, analyses controlling for differences in available habitat in each region do not indicate expansion of climate niches. We therefore cannot reject the hypothesis that observed differences in climate envelopes reflect only the limited environments available within the species{'} native range in East Africa. Our results suggest that models built from only native range occurrence data will not provide an accurate prediction of the potential for invasiveness if applied to areas containing a greater range of environmental combinations, and that tests of niche expansion may overestimate shifts in climate niches if they do not control carefully for environmental differences between distributional areas. },

  Abstract                 = {Species-area relations (SARs) are among the few recognized general patterns of ecology, are empirical relations giving the number of species found within an area of a given size and were initially formulated for island environments. The use of SARs has been extended to mainland environments, and to give baseline estimates of extinction rates attending habitat loss. Using current species distributions based on atlas data, we examined the spatial variation of rates of species accumulation and species-area curves for Proteaceae species for all one-minute by one-minute areas within the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. We compared SARs for current distributions to those generated from modeled future Protea distributions following climate change. Within one biome and for two different scales, there exists a very large spatial variation in turnover rates for current Proteaceae distributions, and we show that these rates will not remain constant as climate warming progresses. As climate changes in coming years, some areas will gain species due to migration, as other areas lose species, and still other areas maintain current rates of species accumulation/turnover. Both current and future distributions show highly variable rates of species accumulation across the landscape. This means that an average species-area relationship will hide a very large interval of variation among SARs, for both current and future Proteaceae distributions. The use of species-area relations to estimate species extinctions following loss of current habitat, or loss of future climatically-suitable area is likely to result in erroneous predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {This Bayesian modeling book is intended for practitioners and applied statisticians looking for a self-contained entry to computational Bayesian statistics. Focusing on standard statistical models and backed up by discussed real datasets available from the book website, it provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather than focusing on its theoretical justifications. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. While R programs are provided on the book website and R hints are given in the computational sections of the book, The Bayesian Core requires no knowledge of the R language and it can be read and used with any other programming language. },

Location North America. Methods We drew taxon occurrence data from the North American pollen records in the Global Pollen Database, representing eight pollen types -all taxa for which 5 distinct geographic occurrences were available in both the present day and at the LGM (21,000 years ago +/- 3000 years). These data were incorporated into ecological niche models based on present-day and LGM climatological summaries available from the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project to produce predicted potential geographic distributions for each species at present and at the LGM. The output for each time period was projected onto the {'}other{'} time period, and tested using independent known occurrence information from that period. Results The result of our analyses was that all species tested showed general conservatism in ecological characteristics over the climate changes associated with the Pleistocene-to-Recent transition. Main conclusions This analysis constitutes a further demonstration of general and pervasive conservatism in ecological niche characteristics over moderate periods of time despite profound changes in climate and environmental conditions. As such, our results reinforce the application of ecological niche modelling techniques to the reconstruction of Pleistocene biodiversity distribution patterns, and to project the future potential distribution range of species in the face of global-scale climatic changes.},

Hypotheses regarding the evolution of migration would generally predict niche-following as primitive, and niche-switching as derived. However, no test has, to our knowledge, yet determined the directionality of evolution of these states within a lineage. We present an analysis of phylogenetic dimensions of seasonal niches in the Passerina buntings that indicates greater evolutionary change in the niches of breeding populations than among those of wintering populations. These results are consistent with hypotheses of (i) niche conservatism (in winter, at least) across a recently speciated lineage; and (ii) the derived state of the breeding (rather than winter) ecological niches of each species.},

We demonstrate this approach with two species for which reintroduction programmes are in the planning stages in Mexico: California condor Gymnogyps californianns and Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi. For the condor, we identify three areas clustered in the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California; for the wolf, we identify a string of suitable sites along the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico. We discuss the limitations of this approach, identifying ways in which the models illustrated could be made more realistic and directly useful to reintroduction programmes.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of the timing of divergence are central to testing the underlying causes of speciation. Relaxed molecular clocks and fossil calibration have improved these estimates; however, these advances are implemented in the context of gene trees, which can overestimate divergence times. Here we couple recent innovations for dating speciation events with the analytical power of species trees, where multilocus data are considered in a coalescent context. Divergence times are estimated in the bird genus Aphelocoma to test whether speciation in these jays coincided with mountain uplift or glacial cycles. Gene trees and species trees show general agreement that diversification began in the Miocene amid mountain uplift. However, dates from the multilocus species tree are more recent, occurring predominately in the Pleistocene, consistent with theory that divergence times can be significantly overestimated with gene-tree based approaches that do not correct for genetic divergence that predates speciation. In addition to coalescent stochasticity, Haldane{'}s rule could account for some differences in timing estimates between mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genes. By incorporating a fossil calibration applied to the species tree, in addition to the process of gene lineage coalescence, the present approach provides a more biologically realistic framework for dating speciation events, and hence for testing the links between diversification and specific biogeographic and geologic events. },

  Abstract                 = {In this first of three papers we examine the use of niche concepts in ecology and especially in species distribution modelling (SDM). This paper deliberately focuses on the lack of clarity found in the term {`}niche{'}. Because its meanings are so diverse, the term niche tends to create confusion and requires constant qualification. The literature houses many idiosyncratic ideas of what the niche is, but few examples where niche is more explanatory than the terminologies of population and community ecology or the statistical methods used to implement SDM analyses. In many cases the original (and inspirational) concepts are not directly applicable to our modern applications (e.g. set theory). There are some conceptual limitations found in individual definitions of niche (e.g. the fundamental niche concept), so it is perhaps understandable why more neutral terminology is becoming popular in SDM. An examination of the literature reveals a wide range of uncritical use of niche terminology. Our findings in this paper do not necessarily support the position of niche as a universally useful concept.},

  Abstract                 = {In a discussion it is often easier to staunchly reject or offer resolute support for an idea. This third paper on the niche concept aims to develop a balanced argument by exploring general principles for determining an appropriate level for pitching the niche concept that will guide better use and less abuse of niche concepts. To do this we first have to accept that niche concepts are not necessarily essential for ecology. Rather than to improve niche concepts, our aim should then be to pitch the niche in terms of ecology. This aim helps us develop an {`}ultimate goal of the niche{'} by which we can evaluate the concepts we use. For species distribution modelling, there has been a focus on the niche as an equilibrium outcome that perhaps has less relevance for disequilibrium situations (e.g. climate change projections). As is the case for much of ecology, more causal explanations of species{'} distributions use alternative terminologies and less frequently use the word {`}niche{'}. We suggest that niche concepts that are better aligned with the rest of ecology could arise from taking more responsibility for our own implementations, and by explaining our models with terms other than niche. A general, holistic niche concept promotes this view and promotes practical thinking about what we are modelling and how we interpret those models, which in turn should help inspire and support innovative modelling approaches in species distribution modelling.},

This, our second paper, develops a practical philosophy for the niche that approaches the concept at the correct level of abstraction. We deconstruct the niche into effect and response components and then reconstruct those parts into a general, visual schematic of the niche and ecology. Using this schematic we examine the relationship of particular niche ideas to ecology, and examine the relationship between niche and ecological sub-disciplines, particularly species distribution modelling (SDM). This general description clarifies the duality of the niche concept, as both a facet of species and a facet of environments. Unclear use of these dual concepts can confuse the scientific approach, and our ideas about uncertainty and error. By misclassifying models as concepts, ecology has confused the niche. Our practical philosophy uses the current wealth of ecological and niche ideas as a panoramic view of a general niche concept. We argue that stitching the niche produces a concept that underpins straightforward ecological thinking.},

Here, we identify and de. ne a rapidly emerging alternative approach, which we formalize as {``}space as a surrogate{''} for unmeasured processes, that is used to maximize inference about ecological processes through the analysis of spatial patterns or spatial residuals alone. This approach requires three elements to be successful: a priori hypotheses, ecological theory and/or knowledge, and precise spatial analysis. We offer new insights into a long-standing debate about process-pattern links in ecology and highlight six recent studies that have successfully examined spatial patterns to understand a diverse array of processes: competition in forest-stand dynamics, dispersal of freshwater fish, movement of American marten, invasion mechanisms of exotic trees, dynamics of natural disturbances, and tropical-plant diversity. Key benefits of using space as a surrogate can be found where experimental manipulation or direct measurements are difficult or expensive to obtain or not possible. We note that, even where experiments can be performed, this procedure may aid in measuring the in situ importance of the processes uncovered through experiments.},

Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services.},

  Abstract                 = {We summarise the contributions of empiricists, modellers, and practitioners in this issue of Biodiversity and Conservation, and highlight the most important areas for future research on species survival in fragmented landscapes. Under the theme {'}uncertainty in research and management{'}, we highlight five areas for future research. First, we know little about the effects of density dependence on the viability of metapopulations, a requirement for fragmented landscapes. Second, successful early attempts suggest that it is worth developing more rigorous calibration methods for population viability analysis with spatially explicit, individual-based models. In particular, the balance between model complexity, ease of calibration, and precision, needs to be addressed. Third, we need to improve methods to discriminate between models, including alternatives to time-series approaches. Fourth, when our ability to reduce model uncertainty is weak, we need to incorporate this uncertainty in population viability analysis. Fifth, population viability analysis and decision analysis can be integrated to make uncertainty an explicit part of the decision process. An important future direction is extending the decision framework to adaptive management. Under the theme {'}tools for quantifying risk and predicting species sensitivity to fragmentation{'}, we highlight three areas for future research. First, we need to develop tools to support comparative approaches to population viability analysis. Second, population modelling can be used to find rules of thumb to support conservation decisions when very little is known about a species. Rules of thumb need to be extended to the problem of managing for multiple species. Third, species{'} traits might be useful for predicting sensitivity but predictions could be further refined by considering the relative importance of population processes at different scales. Under the theme {'}tools for reassembling fragmented landscapes{'}, we consider the {'}focal species{'} approach, and highlight aspects of the approach that require more rigorous testing. Finally, we highlight two important areas for future research not presented in the previous themes or papers in this volume. First, we need to incorporate the deterministic effects of habitat modification into the modelling framework of population viability analysis. Second, an avenue of research that remains largely unexplored is the combination of landscape-scale experiments and population modelling, especially using data from existing fragmentation experiments and from experiments designed to test the effects of defragmenting landscapes.},

Quantitative niche models based on present-day distributions for each of 13 species were projected onto future climate change scenarios.

As observed in other studies, montane systems were relatively more robust to the horizontal effects of climate change on species{'} distributions compared to flatland systems, so range contractions were focused in Southeast Asia and peninsular India. },

Species richness was focused in a narrow east-west band corresponding to the forested parts of the Himalayas with a maximum number of nine species predicted present in these foci. The distributional predictions have a mid-elevation focus with highest species diversity between 1.000 and 2,000 in. Niche breadth and volume were positively related, but accumulation of distributional area (niche volume) decreased with additional environmental combinations (niche breadth). The extent of potential range filling, a measure of distributional disequilibrium, was connected with montane habit (R-2 = 0.422) indicating that montane situations limit the distributional potential of species. },

  Abstract                 = {We determined key photosynthetic gas exchange parameters, and their temperature dependence, in dominant woody plants at four savanna sites on a moisture gradient in Botswana, southern Africa. Leaf stable carbon and nitrogen (N) isotope and morphological measures were made concurrently. Sampling of these predominantly non-N-fixing species took place during an exceptional rainfall season, representing near-optimum conditions for primary production at these sites. The mean specific leaf area and leaf size were positively related to mean annual rainfall (MAR); species with larger leaves of lower density were more abundant in wetter sites. Almost all species at all sites showed high net light-saturated photosynthetic rates (A(max)much greater than10 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) due both to high CO2 carboxylation (V-c,V-max) and RubP-regeneration capacity (J(max)). These high rates were associated with high values of leaf [N]. Across all sites, the temperature response of A(max) showed no clear optimum, and a gradual drop from 25degreesC to 35degreesC, without notable temperature limitation at leaf temperatures in excess of 35degreesC. Dark respiration rate (R-day) across all species and sites increased exponentially with increasing leaf temperature. Species sampled at selected sites revealed a negative relationship between leaf delta(13)C (stable carbon isotope ratio) and MAR, suggesting higher leaf-level water-use efficiency at drier sites when integrated over the life of the leaf. At wetter sites, specific leaf [N] was lower and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency increased, a pattern reflected at the ecosystem level by less N-15 enrichment of leaves at these sites. Taken together, the results suggest a switch from water-use to nitrogen-use efficiency constraints with increasing moisture availability. These constraints impact leaf form and function significantly, and may emerge at the ecosystem level in aspects of water and N cycling. },

  Abstract                 = {The need to understand relationships between biodiversity and carbon cycling (including carbon sequestration) has risen in prominence owing to international interest both in preserving the terrestrial carbon pool and in conserving biodiversity. In this perspective, we highlight that achieving mutual benefits between these aims is clearly promoted by congruence between biodiversity and carbon stocks in tropical latitudes (i.e. high carbon, high biodiversity systems), revealed by recent data and modeling advances, but that mechanisms behind this congruence are not obvious. Furthermore, key processes at subtropical and higher latitudes with less obvious links to biodiversity require policy attention. These processes include wildfire in the subtropics (high biodiversity, low-carbon systems), and ecosystem-level respiration and decomposition at boreal and polar latitudes (low biodiversity, high carbon systems). No clear global relationship between biodiversity and carbon sequestration is apparent, but this does not preclude positive relationships at local to regional scales. There is a growing understanding of the potential value of biodiversity in enhancing carbon management aims, but key knowledge gaps remain that prevent more mature policy development for their co-management. },

The LTER approach has high potential for this purpose in South Africa because of a wealth of historical climate data relative to much of the African continent, and good representation of many African ecosystem types. However, there are substantial challenges to the identification and attribution of climate change impacts on African ecosystems. These are posed by climate variability at a range of time scales, the importance of rainfall rather than temperature as an ecological driver, and the significance of fire as a stochastic disturbance. An awareness of environmental and climate history will be crucial to interpreting data on trends, and sites with established historical data should be preferred for this reason. The placement of LTER sites to provide representivity of ecosystem types may unintentionally limit the detectability of climate change impacts, because change might best be detected in ecotonal or azonal environments. This could be overcome by additional experimental manipulations at LTER sites to {'}force{'} anticipated changes and characterize species and ecosystem responses. A focus on the detection of climate change would sharpen an LTER programme{'}s emphasis over time and provide policy advice, and science training rationales for the long term. It should especially interpret key information to decision-makers as a priority. },

  Abstract                 = {Aim To compare theoretical approaches towards estimating risks of plant species loss to anthropogenic climate change impacts in a biodiversity hotspot, and to develop a practical method to detect signs of climate change impacts on natural populations. Location The Fynbos biome of South Africa, within the Cape Floristic Kingdom. Methods Bioclimatic modelling was used to identify environmental limits for vegetation at both biome and species scale. For the biome as a whole, and for 330 species of the endemic family Proteaceae, tolerance limits were determined for five temperature and water availability-related parameters assumed critical for plant survival. Climate scenarios for 2050 generated by the general circulation models HadCM2 and CSM were interpolated for the region. Geographic Information Systems-based methods were used to map current and future modelled ranges of the biome and 330 selected species. In the biome-based approach, predictions of biome a real loss were overlayed with species richness data for the family Proteaceae to estimate extinction risk. In the species-based approach, predictions of range dislocation (no overlap between current range and future projected range) were used as an indicator of extinction risk. A method of identifying local populations imminently threatened by climate change-induced mortality is also described. Results A loss of Fynbos biome area of between 51% and 65% is projected by 2050 (depending on the climate scenario used), and roughly 10% of the endemic Proteaceae have ranges restricted to the area lost. Species range projections suggest that a third could suffer complete range dislocation by 2050, and only 5% could retain more than two thirds of their range. Projected changes to individual species ranges could be sufficient to detect climate change impacts within ten years. Main conclusions The biome-level approach appears to underestimate the risk of species diversity loss from climate change impacts in the Fynbos Biome because many narrow range endemics suffer range dislocation throughout the biome, and not only in areas identified as biome contractions. We suggest that targeted vulnerable species could be monitored both for early warning signs of climate change and as empirical tests of predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess the potential impact of climate change on plant diversity in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) and its interaction with land transformation that has already occurred in the region. Predictions were made both at the scale of the Fynbos Biome (the dominant vegetation assemblage in the CFR) and for selected Proteaceae species. Bioclimatic modelling identified parts of the biome at particular risk from climate change. Species-level modelling (Generalised Additive Modelling) was done for 28 Proteaceae species selected from areas at high risk of biome loss, revealing individualistic range changes in a pattern broadly consistent with biome modelling results. Most species experienced potential range contractions (17 of 28), of which five showed range elimination. Several species (I I of 28) showed potential range expansions. For species showing range contractions, current land transformation had less impact on future potential ranges than did climate change, because many species ranges shifted to higher altitudes where land transformation is currently less prevalent. Fewer than half of the high-risk species showed overlap between current and future potential range, showing that propagule transport, establishment of species in novel ranges and conservation of landscape linkages will be critical for maintenance of biodiversity. Methods described here provide useful forecasts of potential climate change impacts that could guide conservation responses, but results need cautious interpretation in the light of the many assumptions underlying the techniques used.

  Abstract                 = {Modelling of climate change-induced species range shifts has generally addressed migration limitations inadequately, often assuming {'}null{'} migration or instantaneous {'}full{'} migration extremes. We describe methods for incorporating simple migration rate assumptions into multispecies modelling, using the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic Region. Even with optimistic migration assumptions, range loss projections more closely approximate null migration than full migration assumptions. Full migration results were positively skewed by few species with large range increases, an overestimate eliminated by dispersal-limited migration rate assumptions. Wind- and ant/rodent-dispersed species responded differently to climate change. Initially larger ranges of wind-dispersed species were more strongly reduced by climate change, despite far greater assumed dispersal distances - we suggest that these well-dispersed species populate more marginal areas of potential range, causing lower resilience to climatic changes at range margins. Overall, range loss rate slowed with advancing climate change, possibly because species ranges contracted into core areas most resilient to climate change. Thus, a consideration of simple dynamics of range change (rather than single step, present-future comparisons of range) provide new insights relevant for conservation strategies, in particular, and for guiding monitoring efforts to detect and gauge the impacts of climate change on natural populations.},

Plant stomatal conductances and water-use efficiencies were related to soil water content. High, opportunistic stomatal conductance and low water-use efficiency occurred at high soil water content, when the lower stomatal conductance required for optimum water-use efficiency may represent a competitive disadvantage. Water-use efficiency increased as soil dried to intermediate soil water contents, but stomatal conductance finally became conservative and water-use efficiency decreased again at very low soil water content. This response may lengthen growing season and defer lethal water stress. This combination of opportunistic and parsimonious water use may facilitate the competitive success and resilience of these species under semi-arid and arid conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {The physiognomically distinct Fynbos and Succulent Karoo Biomes are associated with the winter or all season rainfall region of southwestern South Africa. Fynbos (the more mesic) is co-dominated by small trees, shrubs and reed-like plants. Woody stemmed succulent shrubs, mainly small leaved, dominate the Succulent Karoo. Both biomes contain spectacular floristic richness, Have past climates determined present species richness in this region? We employed GIS-based bioclimatic modelling techniques to address this. After deriving bioclimatic envelopes for both Fynbos Biome (Fynbos Envelope, FYE) and Succulent Karoo (SKE), we used modelled paleoclimate reconstructions to map the distribution of the envelopes at 6, 12 and 18 kBP in the southern and western Cape. At the LGM, FYE possibly had a considerably greater extent along the west coast and the western interior, replacing much of the SKE. At 18 kBP SKE was limited to two separate areas, an extensive plain, the Knersvlakte (South) and montane Richtersveld (North). SKE expanded between 12 and 6 kBP to its present range, and FYE contracted into its current montane distribution. These reconstructions concur with the palynological record of indicator groups of both biomes, with current patterns of relictual Fynbos vegetation, and with Succulent Karoo centres of endemism. Climatic oscillations during the pleistocene probably shifted these biomes iteratively along a North/South axis on the west coast of southern Africa. Mutual vegetation replacements are likely to have accelerated sympatric and allopatric speciation, giving rise to high beta and gamma species turnover. },

This study aimed to determine the effect of overtopping and shading by the alien invasive plant species Acacia cyclops on the gas exchange characteristics and photosynthetic capacity of Rhus glauca and R. lucida, both indigenous heliophilous shrub species in the western Cape Province of South Africa. 2. Overtopped individuals of both indigenous species showed morphological and physiological changes generally consistent with widely reported shade effects. However, R. lucida showed an apparently rare combination of unchanged maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max)) and increased apparent quantum yield (alpha) under shaded conditions. 3. The major constraint to photosynthesis in the otherwise well-adapted alien-shaded individuals of R. lucida appeared to be stomatal lags in response to rapid changes in light, and an inappropriate diurnal stomatal rhythm. This limitation in R. lucida, together with the lower respiratory costs incurred by shaded R. glauca, suggest that R. glauca was the better adapted of the two species to deep shade conditions beneath the alien canopy. This advantage may be accentuated by an apparent lack of competition for soil water resources between R. glauca and the alien. 4. The suite of morphological and physiological adaptations shown by R. lucida may equip this species better for survival in a more exposed position at the edge of an overtopping canopy. },

  Abstract                 = {The combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and nutrient supply rate on plant biomass accumulation were determined for four Leucadendron species (Proteaceae) of the mediterranean climate Fynbos Biome, South Africa. Juvenile individuals were grown for 6 months in experiments comprising 2X2 factorial combinations of substrate nutrient supply rate and atmospheric CO2 concentration in open-top chambers in a greenhouse. The four selected Leucadendron species included one pair of species common on extremely nutrient-poor acid sands (typical of the Fynbos Biome), and another pair associated with more nutrient rich substrates (rare in the Fynbos Biome). Plant biomass accumulation data were analysed to explore the determinants of plant CO2 responsiveness, particularly the role of plant sink strength characteristics. Results lead us to speculate that the nitrogen:phosphorus supply ratio may have limited plant CO2 responsiveness in three of the four species under conditions of higher nutrient supply rate. Intrinsic plant growth characteristics, possibly related to the relative ability of the species to generate sinks, may ultimately have limited the capacity of all species to respond to elevated CO2. },

  Abstract                 = {We provide a position paper, using a brief literature review and some new modelling results for a subset of succulent plant species, which explores why Namaqualand plant diversity might be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change despite presumed species resilience under arid conditions, and therefore a globally important test-bed for adaptive conservation strategies. The Pleistocene climate-related evolutionary history of this region in particular may predispose Namaqualand (and Succulent Karoo) plant endemics to projected climate change impacts. Key Succulent Karoo plant lineages originated during cool Pleistocene times, and projected air temperatures under anthropogenic climate change are likely to exceed these significantly. Projected rainfall patterns are less certain, and projections of the future prevalence of coastal fog are lacking, but if either of these water inputs is reduced in concert with rising temperatures, this seems certain to threaten the persistence of, at least, narrow-endemic plant species. Simple modelling approaches show strong reduction in spatial extent of bioclimates typical of Namaqualand within the next five decades and that both generalist species with large geographic ranges, and narrow-range endemics may be susceptible to climate change induced loss of potential range. Persistence of endemics in micro-habitats that are buffered from extreme climate conditions cannot be discounted, though no attempts have been made to address this shortcoming of broader scale bioclimatic modelling. The few experimental data available on elevated temperature and drought tolerance suggest susceptibility of leaf succulent species, but high drought tolerance of non-succulent shrubs. Both species-level monitoring and further experimental work is essential to test and refine projections of climate change impacts on species persistence, and the implications for conservation.

The aim was to determine if the same patterns of gas exchange and ancillary parameters could be obtained with rather different measurement systems, and whether the same interpretation and conclusions about environmental control of gas exchange could be drawn. The following systems were compared: 1, a {'}closed{'} portable IRGA manufactured by LI-Cor (LI-6200); 2, an {'}open{'} portable porometer manufactured by Walz; and 3, a continuously monitoring minicuvette system with temperature control facility, also manufactured by Walt. All three systems yielded similar diurnal curves for CO2 uptake, although absolute flux values for the minicuvette system were lower than those obtained for the portable systems. This was likely due to stem respiration and self-shading of leaves on the shoot enclosed in the minicuvette. Differences in sampling technique between the two portable systems, primarily with regard to changes in leaf orientation, resulted in some differences in absolute values of gas fluxes and ancillary parameters such as leaf temperature and leaf to air vapour pressure difference. However, data from all three systems allowed similar interpretations to be made about the environmental dependencies of gas exchange patterns. It appears that each system has certain drawbacks associated with widely varying field conditions. A combination of portable and continuous monitoring techniques would seem to be the most powerful approach to investigating the gas exchange patterns of terrestrial plants in their natural environment. },

Leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was measured in populations of plants grown from seeds of selected generations which had experienced different UV-B exposure histories, and from seeds collected from a wild population of this species which grows in a naturally enhanced UV-B environment. These measured plants had been grown in a greenhouse under essentially UV-B-free conditions. Leaf FA was significantly increased by greater numbers of enhanced W-B exposures in the parentage of the seed. There was a linear to exponential dose-response relationship between number of UV-B exposure iterations in seed parentage and leaf FA, suggesting that damage to DNA caused by UV-B exposure during plant development may not be fully repaired, and thus be inherited by offspring and accumulated over successive generations in this species, Leaf FA of plants grown from seed from the wild population was not significantly greater than that of control plants whose parentage experienced only ambient UV-B exposures, although this negative result may have been due to low sampling intensity and measurement resolution, and the relatively low UV-B enhancement experienced by the wild population. We conclude that leaf FA may constitute a relatively sensitive yet inexpensive means of quantifying UV-B damage to plants. },

Photosynthetic parameters were related to leaf nutrient and carbohydrate status to reveal controls of carbon uptake rate. In ail species, elevated CO2 depressed both the maximum Rubisco catalytic activity (V-c,V-max, by 19-44%) and maximum electron transport rate (J(max) by 13-39%), indicating significant photosynthetic acclimation of both measures. Even so, all species had increased maximum light-saturated rate of net CO2 uptake (A(max)) at the elevated growth CO2 level, due to higher intercellular CO2 concentration (c(i)). Leaf nitrogen concentration was central to photosynthetic performance, correlating with A(max), V-c,V-max and J(max). V-c,V-max and J(max) were linearly cc-correlated, revealing a relatively invariable J(max):V-c,V-max ratio, probably due to N resource optimization between light harvesting (RuBP regeneration) and carboxylation. Leaf total non-structural carbohydrate concentration (primarily starch) increased in high CO2, and was correlated with the reduction in V-c,V-max and J(max). Apparent feedback control of V-c,V-max and J(max) was thus surprisingly consistent across all species, and may regulate carbon exchange in response to end-product fluctuation. If so, elevated CO2 may have emulated an excess end-product condition, triggering both V-c,V-max and J(max) down-regulation. In Leucadendron, a general physiological mechanism seems to control excess carbohydrate formation, and photosynthetic responsiveness to elevated CO2, independently of genotype and nutrient concentration. This mechanism may underlie photosynthetic acclimation to source:sink imbalances resulting from such diverse conditions as elevated CO2, low sink strength, low carbohydrate export, and nutrient limitation. },

  Abstract                 = {Generalized linear models (GLMs) and classification trees were developed to predict the presence of four vegetation alliances in a section of the Mojave Desert in California. Generalized additive models were used to provide response shapes for parameterizing GLMs. Environmental variables used to model the distribution of the alliances included temperature, precipitation, elevation, elevation-derived terrain variables (slope, transformed aspect, topographic moisture index, solar radiation, and landscape position), and categorical landform/surface composition variables. Vegetation distributions exhibit spatial dependence and therefore we used indicator kriging to derive neighborhood values of "presence" also used as predictors in the models. The models were developed using 2859 observations coded present or absent for each of the four alliances, and assessed using 960 observations. In general, all of the models were improved with the addition of the kriged dependence term. However, models that relied heavily on the kriged dependence term were less generalizable for predictive purposes. Classification tree models had higher classification accuracy with the training data, but were less robust when used for predictions with the test data. Each of the models was used to generate a map of predictions for each alliance and the results were often quite different. The predicted maps with the kriged dependence terms looked unrealistically smooth, particularly in the classification tree models where they were often selected as the most important variables, and therefore heavily influenced the spatial pattern of the resulting map predictions.

  Abstract                 = {Aim To relate the dispersal limitation of endemic terrestrial mammals in Mexico to species life-history traits and latitude. Location Mexico. Methods We modelled species ecological niches projected as potential distributions (P) using point occurrence data and 19 environmental variables for 89 endemic mammal species, and compared the areas covered by these ecological niche models with maps of species actual distributions (R) based on minimum convex polygons connecting marginal records based on museum specimens. We correlated body mass, food habits (herbivore, omnivore, insectivore, frugivore/granivore), volant and non-volant (fossorial, arboreal, terrestrial) habits and mean latitude to the proportion of occupancy of species potential distributional areas (R/P). Results R and P were significantly positively correlated, with an overall average R/P ratio of 0.49. Less than half of the endemics (41 species) had a high occupancy (R/P values ranging from 0.50 to 0.90); a few (four species) showed full occupancy (\textgreater 0.90). Body mass and food habits were not correlated with R/P, but latitude showed significant correlations with R/P; volant mammals tended to show higher R/P values than non-volant mammals. Main conclusions Few species filled most of the spatial extent of their ecological niches. Life-history traits were generally poor predictors of proportional occupancy of species potential distributions. Endemics occurring at higher latitudes showed higher occupancy, suggesting that abiotic factors are likely to limit their distributions. Conversely, species at lower latitudes showed lower occupancy, suggesting that their distributions are limited by biotic factors and/or by geographical or historical barriers that prevent dispersal. The dispersal abilities of volant compared with non-volant endemics can explain the higher occupancy in species potential distributions in the former group. These trends provide a baseline for exploring the importance of life-history traits and abiotic versus biotic factors in limiting species distributions. },

  Abstract                 = {It has been argued that ecological theory has not been useful to the practice of biological control. The purpose of this article is to show how recent theoretical advances may reverse this situation. We first discuss four issues that have arisen in the development of theory for biological control. (1) Recent work has clarified and resolved earlier disagreements concerning the effect of aggregation of the parasitoid to local host density on the stability of parasitoid-host models; this work emphasizes that such aggregation increases the ability of the parasitoid to reduce pest density, (2) There has been disagreement over the conditions under which stability, in the mathematical sense and on a local spatial scale, is an appropriate goal for classical biological control of insect pests, and whether a metapopulation may sometimes provide a more appropriate framework. We also comment on (3) relative size of refuges, which has been proposed as a unifying concept, and (4) density dependence and ratio dependence. We then discuss recent models using a stage-structured approach, particularly those that compare potential biological control agents or agents that have been differentially successful in practice. We argue that this approach has already produced valuable insights into the factors operating in several field situations. It demonstrates the importance of identifying which pest stages are most injurious to the crop, since the natural enemy that wins in competition may not be the most effective at suppressing the crucial pest stage(s): in general, the winning parasitoid reduces the density of the host stage attacked by its competitor below the level at which the latter can maintain a positive growth rate when at low density. A useful criterion is that pest equilibrium density is suppressed most by the parasitoid species that needs the fewest host individuals to allow a female parasitoid to replace herself in the next generation. Caveats are that this may apply only under equilibrium conditions and that the pest stage most suppressed is the one we wish to control. We discuss the connection between successful biological control and evolutionary considerations.},

  Abstract                 = {The performance of fifth generation offspring of a desert annual (Dimorphotheca sinuata DC.) were compared in the absence of UV-B, under variable atmospheric CO2 and nutrient supply after four consecutive generations of concurrent exposure of their progenitors to UV-B at ambient (seasonal range: 2.55-8.85 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) and enhanced (seasonal range: 4.70-11.41 kJ m-2 d(-1)) levels. Offspring of progenitors grown under elevated UV-B exhibited a diminished photosynthetic rate, a consequence of a reduced leaf density, and diminished foliar levels of carotenoids, polyphenolics and anthocyanins. Conversely nonstructural carbohydrate and chlorophyll b levels were increased. Altered physiology was accompanied by reduced apical dominance and earlier flowering, features generally considered under photomorphogenic control, increased branching and inflorescence production and greater partitioning of biomass to reproductive structures, but diminished seed production. Many of these changes were magnified under nutrient limitation and intensified under atmospheric CO2 enriched conditions. The latter disagrees with current opinion that elevated CO2 may reduce detrimental UVB effects, at least over the long-term. Observed correlations between seed production and polyphenolic, especially anthocyanin, levels in offspring, and indications of diminished lignification (thinner leaves, less robust stems and fewer lignified seeds set) all pointed to the involvement of the phenylpropanoid pathway in seed formation and plant structural development and its disruption during long-term UV-B exposure. Comparisons with earlier generations revealed trends with cumulative generations of enhanced UVB exposure of increasing chlorophyll b and nonstructural carbohydrates, decreasing polyphenolics and biomass allocation to vegetative structures, and diminishing seed production despite increasing biomass allocation to reproductive structures. Notwithstanding some physiological compensation (increased chlorophyll b), the accumulation and persistence of these ostensibly inherited changes in physiological and reproductive performance suggest a greater impact of elevated UV-B on vegetation, primary production and regeneration over the long-term than presently envisaged. },

Passive daytime warming (averaging 5.5degreesC above ambient) of the natural vegetation was achieved with 18 transparent hexagonal open-top chamber arrays randomized in three different quartz-field communities. After 4-months summer treatment, the specialized-dwarf and shrubby succulents displayed between 2.1 and 4.9 times greater plant and canopy mortalities in the open-top chambers than in the control plots. Those surviving in cooler ventilated areas and shaded refuges in the chambers had lower starch concentrations and water contents; the shrubby succulents also exhibited diminished chlorophyll concentrations. It is concluded that current thermal regimes are likely to be closely proximate to tolerable extremes for many endemic succulents in the region, and that anthropogenic warming could significantly exceed their thermal thresholds. Further investigation is required to elucidate the importance of associated moisture deficits in these warming experiments, a potential consequence of supplementary (fog and dew) precipitation interception by open-top chambers and higher evaporation therein, on plant mortalities. },

The choice of a model is carried out by taking into account not only the traditional model selection criteria (i.e., a model{'}s fit to the data and the number of parameters) but also the extension of the parameter space, and, most importantly, the functional form of the model (i.e., the way in which the parameters are combined in the model{'}s equation). An advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of non-nested models as well as nested ones. Application examples are presented and implications of the results for evaluating models of cognition are discussed.},

The aim of this work was to determine whether or not differences among subspecies and clades translate into distinct ecological niches. We used 223 isolates from humans and wildlife representing all six genotypes (type A, B, A1, A2, A1a, or A1b). Ecological-niche models were built independently for each genotype, using the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction. The resulting models were compared using a non-parametric multivariate analysis-of-variance method. A1 and A2 are ecologically distinct, supporting the previously observed geographic division, whereas ecological niches for types A and B overlapped notably but A1a and A1b displayed no appreciable differences in their ecological niches. },

The results indicate that these diseases are indeed shifting in accord with patterns of climatic shift, but that overall geographic shifts will likely be subtle, with some northward movement of southern limits and possibly northward movement of northern limits as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Wavelet methods have recently undergone a rapid period of development with important implications for a number of disciplines including statistics. This book fulfils three purposes. First, it is a gentle introduction to wavelets and their uses in statistics. Second, it acts as a quick and broad reference to many recent developments in the area. The book concentrates on describing the essential elements and provides comprehensive source material references. Third, the book intersperses R code that explains and demonstrates both wavelet and statistical methods. The code permits the user to learn the methods, to carry out their own analyses and further develop their own methods. The book is designed to be read in conjunction with WaveThresh4, the freeware R package for wavelets. The book introduces the wavelet transform by starting with the simple Haar wavelet transform and then builds to consider more general wavelets such as the Daubechies compactly supported series. The book then describes the evolution of wavelets in the directions of complex-valued wavelets, non-decimated transforms, multiple wavelets and wavelet packets as well as giving consideration to boundary conditions initialization. Later chapters explain the role of wavelets in nonparametric regression problems via a variety of techniques including thresholding, cross-validation, SURE, false-discovery rate and recent Bayesian methods, and also consider how to deal with correlated and non-Gaussian noise structures. The book also looks at how nondecimated and packet transforms can improve performance. The penultimate chapter considers the role of wavelets in both stationary and non-stationary time series analysis. The final chapter describes recent work concerning the role of wavelets for variance stabilization for non-Gaussian intensity estimation. The book is aimed at final year undergraduate and Masters students in a numerate discipline (such as mathematics, statistics, physics, economics and engineering) and would also suit as a quick reference for postgraduate or research level activity. The book would be ideal for a researcher to learn about wavelets, to learn how to use wavelet software and then to adapt the ideas for their own purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {A natural focus of plague exists in the Western Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Despite intense research, questions remain as to why and how plague emerges repeatedly in the same suite of villages. We used human plague incidence data for 1986-2003 in an ecological-niche modeling framework to explore the geographic distribution and ecology of human plague. Our analyses indicate that plague Occurrence is related directly to landscape-scale environmental features, yielding a predictive understanding of one set of environmental factors affecting plague transmission in East Africa. Although many environmental variables contribute significantly to these models, the most important are elevation and Enhanced Vegetation Index derivatives. Projections of these models across broader regions predict only 15.5% (under a majority-rule threshold) or 31,997 km(2) of East Africa as suitable for plague transmission, but they successfully anticipate most known foci in the region, making possible the development of a risk map of plague. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: Plague is a rapidly progressing, serious illness in humans that is likely to be fatal if not treated. It remains a public health threat, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In spite of plague{'}s highly focal nature, a thorough ecological understanding of the general distribution pattern of plague across sub-Saharan Africa has not been established to date. In this study, we used human plague data from sub-Saharan Africa for 1970-2007 in an ecological niche modeling framework to explore the potential geographic distribution of plague and its ecological requirements across Africa. Results: We predict a broad potential distributional area of plague occurrences across sub-Saharan Africa. General tests of model{'}s transferability suggest that our model can anticipate the potential distribution of plague occurrences in Madagascar and northern Africa. However, generality and predictive ability tests using regional subsets of occurrence points demonstrate the models to be unable to predict independent occurrence points outside the training region accurately. Visualizations show plague to occur in diverse landscapes under wide ranges of environmental conditions. Conclusion: We conclude that the typical focality of plague, observed in sub-Saharan Africa, is not related to fragmented and insular environmental conditions manifested at a coarse continental scale. However, our approach provides a foundation for testing hypotheses concerning focal distribution areas of plague and their links with historical and environmental factors. },

  Abstract                 = {Commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted as a means of sustainably developing tropical forest resources, in a way that promotes forest conservation while supporting rural livelihoods. However, in practice, NTFP commercialization has often failed to deliver the expected benefits. Progress in analyzing the causes of such failure has been hindered by the lack of a suitable framework for the analysis of NTFP case studies, and by the lack of predictive theory. We address these needs by developing a probabilistic model based on a livelihood framework, enabling the impact of NTFP commercialization on livelihoods to be predicted. The framework considers five types of capital asset needed to support livelihoods: natural, human, social, physical, and financial. Commercialization of NTFPs is represented in the model as the conversion of one form of capital asset into another, which is influenced by a variety of socio-economic, environmental, and political factors. Impacts on livelihoods are determined by the availability of the five types of assets following commercialization. The model, implemented as a Bayesian Belief Network, was tested using data from participatory research into 19 NTFP case studies undertaken in Mexico and Bolivia. The model provides a novel tool for diagnosing the causes of success and failure in NTFP commercialization, and can be used to explore the potential impacts of policy options and other interventions on livelihoods. The potential value of this approach for the development of NTFP theory is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Although sustainable forest management (SFM) has been widely adopted as a policy and management goal, high rates of forest loss and degradation are still occurring in many areas. Human activities such as logging, livestock husbandry, crop cultivation, infrastructural development, and use of fire are causing widespread loss of biodiversity, restricting progress toward SFM. In such situations, there is an urgent need for tools that can provide an integrated assessment of human impacts on forest biodiversity and that can support decision making related to forest use. This paper summarizes the experience gained by an international collaborative research effort spanning more than a decade, focusing on the tropical montane forests of Mexico and the temperate rain forests of southern South America, both of which are global conservation priorities. The lessons learned from this research are identified, specifically in relation to developing an integrated modeling framework for achieving SFM. Experience has highlighted a number of challenges that need to be overcome in such areas, including the lack of information regarding ecological processes and species characteristics and a lack of forest inventory data, which hinders model parameterization. Quantitative models are poorly developed for some ecological phenomena, such as edge effects and genetic diversity, limiting model integration. Establishment of participatory approaches to forest management is difficult, as a supportive institutional and policy environment is often lacking. However, experience to date suggests that the modeling toolkit approach suggested by Sturvetant et al. (2008) could be of value in such areas. Suggestions are made regarding desirable elements of such a toolkit to support participatory-research approaches in domains characterized by high uncertainty, including Bayesian Belief Networks, spatial multi-criteria analysis, and scenario planning. }

  Abstract                 = {Effective conservation management is dependent on accessing and integrating different forms of evidence regarding the potential impacts of management interventions. Here, we explore the application of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), which are graphical models that incorporate probabilistic relationships among variables of interest, to evidence-based conservation management. We consider four case studies, namely: (i) impacts of deer grazing on saltmarsh vegetation; (ii) impacts of burning on upland bog vegetation; (iii) control of the invasive exotic plant Rhododendron ponticum; and (iv) management of lowland heathland by burning. Each of these themes is currently a significant conservation issue in the UK, and yet the potential outcomes of management interventions are poorly understood. Through these examples, we demonstrate that BBNs can be used to integrate and explore evidence from a variety of sources, including expert opinion and quantitative results from research investigations. Incorporation of such information in BBNs enables different sources of evidence to be compared, the potential impacts of management interventions to be explored and management trade-offs to be identified. BBNs also offer a highly visual tool for communicating the uncertainty associated with potential management outcomes to conservation practitioners, and they can also be readily updated as new evidence becomes available. Based on these features, we suggest that BBNs have outstanding potential for supporting evidence-based approaches to conservation management. (C) 2007 Elsevier GrnbH. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Ostensibly simple probabilistic reasoning problems are sometimes surprisingly difficult, One source of difficulty is the omission from a problem description of information essential to an unambiguous understanding of the situation. When this is so, assumptions must be made to permit the computation of probabilities. Different assumptions lead to different conclusions, and if the assumptions are not stated, disagreements regarding problem solutions can occur, even among experts. The author reviews several such problems and their treatment in the literature. He proposes accounts of why problems can be difficult even when not ambiguous and discusses some approaches that can make solutions easier to find or understand.},

  Abstract                 = {This book provides a detailed presentation of all basics of statistical inference for psychologists, both in a fisherian and a bayesian approach. Although many authors have recently advocated for the use of bayesian statistics in psychology (Wagenmaker et al., 2010, 2011; Kruschke, 2010; Rouder et al., 2009) statistical manuals for psychologists barely mention them. This manual provides a full bayesian toolbox for commonly encountered problems in psychology and social sciences, for comparing proportions, variances and means, and discusses the advantages. But all foundations of the frequentist approach are also provided, from data description to probability and density, through combinatorics and set algebra. A special emphasis has been put on the analysis of categorical data and contingency tables. Binomial and multinomial models with beta and Dirichlet priors are presented, and their use for making (between rows or between cells) contrasts in contingency tables is detailed on real data. An automatic search of the best model for all problem types is implemented in the AtelieR package, available on CRAN. ANOVA is also presented in a Bayesian flavor (using BIC), and illustrated on real data with the help of the AtelieR and R2STATS packages (a GUI for GLM and GLMM in R). In addition to classical and Bayesian inference on means, direct and Bayesian inference on effect size and standardized effects are presented, in agreement with recent APA recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim To evaluate whether observed geographical shifts in the distribution of the blue-winged macaw (Primolius maracana) are related to ongoing processes of global climate change. This species is vulnerable to extinction and has shown striking range retractions in recent decades, withdrawing broadly from southern portions of its historical distribution. Its range reduction has generally been attributed to the effects of habitat loss; however, as this species has also disappeared from large forested areas, consideration of other factors that may act in concert is merited. Location Historical distribution of the blue-winged macaw in Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. Methods We used a correlative approach to test a hypothesis of causation of observed shifts by reduction of habitable areas mediated by climate change. We developed models of the ecological niche requirements of the blue-winged macaw, based on point-occurrence data and climate scenarios for pre-1950 and post-1950 periods, and tested model predictivity for anticipating geographical distributions within time periods. Then we projected each model to the other time period and compared distributions predicted under both climate scenarios to assess shifts of habitable areas across decades and to evaluate an explanation for observed range retractions. Results Differences between predicted distributions of the blue-winged macaw over the twentieth century were, in general, minor and no change in suitability of landscapes was predicted across large areas of the species{'} original range in different time periods. No tendency towards range retraction in the south was predicted, rather conditions in the southern part of the species{'} range tended to show improvement for the species. Main conclusions Our test permitted elimination of climate change as a likely explanation for the observed shifts in the distribution of the blue-winged macaw, and points rather to other causal explanations (e.g. changing regional land use, emerging diseases).},

Our models provided predictions of areas already invaded that were statistically significantly more coincident than expected under random (null) models. The predicted potential range of the species includes areas already affected, as well as potentially suitable areas in Central America, the Caribbean, equatorial and West Africa, and mainland and insular Southeast Asia, not yet colonized.},

  Abstract                 = {Coyotes and lynx are the two most important mammalian predators of snowshoe hares throughout much of the boreal forest. Populations of hares cycle in abundance, with peaks in density occurring every 8-11 yr, and experimental results suggest that predation is a necessary factor causing these cycles. We measured the functional responses of coyotes and lynx during a cyclic fluctuation of hare populations in the southwest Yukon, to determine their effect on the cyclic dynamics. We used snow-tracking and radio telemetry to examine changes in the foraging behavior of the predators. Coyotes and lynx both fed mostly on hares during all winters except during cyclic lows, when the main alternative prey of coyotes was voles, and lynx switched to hunting red squirrels. Both predators showed clear functional responses to changes in the densities of hares. Kill rates of hares by coyotes varied from 0.3 to 2.3 hares/d, with the most hares killed one year before the cyclic peak, while those of lynx varied from 0.3 to 1.2 hares/d, with the highest one year after the peak. Maximum kill rates by both predators were greater than their energetic needs. The functional response of coyotes was equally well described by linear and type-2 curves, and that of lynx was well described by a type-2 curve. Kill rates by coyotes were higher during the increase in density of hares than during the cyclic decline, while the reverse was true for lynx. Coyotes killed more hares early in the winter, and cached many of these for later retrieval. Lower densities of hares were associated with longer reactive distances of both predators to hares, but with little apparent change in time spent searching or handling prey. In summary, our data show that the two similarly sized predators differed in their foraging behavior and relative abilities at capturing alternative prey, leading to different patterns in their functional responses to fluctuations in the density of their preferred prey.},

We use ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify areas adequate for overwintering monarch colonies under both current and future climate scenarios. The ENM approach permits testing and validation of model predictivity, and yields quantitative, testable predictions regarding likely future climate change effects. Our models predicted monarch presence with a high degree of accuracy, and indicated that precipitation and diurnal temperature range were key environmental factors in making locations suitable for monarchs. When we projected monarch distribution onto future climate scenarios (Hadley Centre climate models), we found that conditions were likely to be inadequate across the entire current winter range, particularly owing to increased cool-weather precipitation that could cause increased mortality. This study applies ENM to understanding the seasonal dynamics of a migratory species under climate change, and uses ENM to identify key limiting environmental parameters in species{'} responses to climate change.},

Ecological niches were modelled and potential distributions delimited for 285 bird and 114 mammal species using a genetic algorithm based on locality information from museum specimens and 15 selected environmental attributes. Potential distributions were transformed into hypothesized current distributions based on species-habitat associations as reflected in a recent land-use map. Although species richness was lower when distributions were reduced from potential to current, spatial patterns of potential and current richness were similar. Heuristic, complementarity-based prioritization procedures were used to identify combinations of areas and sites with maximal species representation: the biosphere reserves included 79% of birds and 74% of mammal species; eight priority areas provided an additional 11% of birds and 13% of mammals; the remaining 10% of birds and 13% of mammals were concentrated in new sites across the study area.},

Although the broadly disjunct distribution of the species would suggest that two taxa are involved, morphological differences between the populations appear minor, not deserving of formal taxonomic recognition. Ecological differences between the two populations are stronger, however; modeled ecological niches are nearly nonoverlapping, and ontogenetic and behavioral differences may exist. We recommend that, given its extremely restricted distribution, the Veracruz population be considered critically endangered, whereas the Yucatan population be designated as having a restricted range and accorded near-threatened status.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in building predictive models of species distributions over large geographic areas. As larger areas are modelled, however, it is highly likely that heterogeneity in the predictors variable increases and that areas are included where animals respond to habitats in different ways, for example, due to social status. These effects (spatial non-stationary) may weaken model performance. This paper explores whether data partitioning prior to analysis can improve the tit of models and provide ecological insight into distribution patterns. Data on three bird species were modelled for the whole of Spain at 1 km(2) resolution using logistic regression analysis. Data were partitioned into geographic quarters, concentric rings around the centroid of the distribution, and into random samples for comparison. In all cases, data partitioning produced better models as assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) statistics than analysis of the global data set. Inclusion of latitude and longitude improved the global models only when added as smoothed splines but produced different probabilities to the partitioned data. Geographic partitioning is a very crude local modelling approach and we suggest that some form of geographically-weighted regression could offer the best solution to large-scale modelling but is computationally intensive on Geographical Information Systems (GIs) data. It is concluded that simple partitioning by geographic quarters may detect spatial non-stationary and alert the modeller to possible problems; that partitioning into more novel arrangements may be used to test ecological hypotheses; and that data should not be partitioned spatially to build and test models if non-stationary is suspected.

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the goals of meta-analysis, critique its recent application in ecology, and highlight an approach that more explicitly links meta-analysis and ecological theory. One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta-analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes (e.g., due to differences in experimental protocol, parameter values, or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta-analysis, by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales, and time-series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models, and associated metrics of effect size, in meta-analysis by discussing and/or synthesizing data on species interactions, mutual interference between consumers, and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single, specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size. The successful application of meta-analysis in ecology will benefit by clear and explicit linkages among ecological theory, the questions being addressed, and the metrics used to summarize the available information.},

  Abstract                 = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a {'}systematic trend{'}. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles ( or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial {'}sign-switching{'} responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates {'}very high confidence{'} (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A generalized decline of amphibian populations is occurring worldwide. The causes for such a decline are not completely understood; however, climate change has been identified as a possible cause for amphibian extinction, among others. Ecological niche modeling has proven to be a useful tool to predict potential distribution of species in the context of climatic changes. In this paper, we used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the potential distributions of two species of plethodontid salamanders: Pseudoeurycea cephalica and P leprosa. We projected their potential distributions under climatic scenarios expected in 50 yr based on a conservative scenario of global climate change and assuming a moderate dispersal ability for both species. Our analyses suggest that climate change effects may pose an additional long-term risk to both species of plethodontid salamanders, with a more dramatic scenario in the case of P leprosa. By the year 2050, this species may lose almost 75 percent of its distributional area, and this projection is even worse when deforestation (in the way it is occurring at present) is considered within the predicted model. Our results concur with those obtained for species with limited dispersal capability because they do not track changing climates, but rather face a loss of distributional area. The survival of these species is not secure, even though their potential distributional area falls within a considerable number of natural protected areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations have been used extensively to explore the possible dynamic outcomes of interspecific competition. But while there have been hundreds of papers on the mathematical properties of Lotka-Volterra models, there have been only a handful of papers that explore techniques for fitting these models to actual data, and no papers that explore the interface of experimental design and statistical inference when fitting LV equations to census data. In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gause{'}s experimental cultures of Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum, using analytical methods based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches in addressing several questions about competition from experimental data: Are the mutual effects of competing populations substantial? Are these competitive effects symmetrical? Are two populations expected to coexist or to eliminate each other by competition? We show that even a laboratory-derived data set with minimal variability can entail significant levels of uncertainty about the nature of the competitive interaction. We assess the errors involved in estimating the strength and symmetry of competition, and find that one{'}s conclusions depend critically on assumptions about sources of variability in the data. We also estimate the probabilities of alternative dynamic behaviors for competing species. We use simulations to evaluate how particular experimental designs might improve our power to characterize the dynamic; outcome of competition. We show that much more information is gained by running competition experiments at different starring conditions than by replicating the same experiment for a particular starting condition.},

  Abstract                 = {A model, A Spatial Evaluation of Climate Impact on the Envelope of Species (SPECIES), is presented which has been developed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the bioclimatic envelope of plant species in Great Britain. SPECIES couples an artificial neural network with a climate-hydrological process model. The hybrid model has been successfully trained to estimate current species distributions using climate and soils data at the European scale before application at a finer resolution national scale. Using this multi-scale approach ensures encapsulation of the full extent of future climate scenarios within Great Britain without extrapolating outside of the model{'}s training dataset. Application of the model to 32 plant species produced a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.841 and a mean Kappa statistic of 0.772 between observed and simulated distributions. Simulations of four climate change scenarios revealed that changes to suitable climate space in Great Britain is highly species dependent and that distribution changes may be multidirectional and temporally non-linear. Analysis of the SPECIES results suggests that the neural network methodology can provide a feasible alternative to more classical spatial statistical techniques. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Aim Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location Madagascar. Methods Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km(2) grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species.},

Here we investigate the impact that the choice of model can have on predictions, identify key reasons why model output may differ and discuss the implications that model uncertainty has for policy-guiding applications. Location The Western Cape of South Africa. Methods We applied nine of the most widely used modelling techniques to model potential distributions under current and predicted future climate for four species (including two subspecies) of Proteaceae. Each model was built using an identical set of five input variables and distribution data for 3996 sampled sites. We compare model predictions by testing agreement between observed and simulated distributions for the present day (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa statistics) and by assessing consistency in predictions of range size changes under future climate (using cluster analysis). Results Our analyses show significant differences between predictions from different models, with predicted changes in range size by 2030 differing in both magnitude and direction (e.g. from 92% loss to 322% gain). We explain differences with reference to two characteristics of the modelling techniques: data input requirements (presence/absence vs. presence-only approaches) and assumptions made by each algorithm when extrapolating beyond the range of data used to build the model. The effects of these factors should be carefully considered when using this modelling approach to predict species ranges. Main Conclusions We highlight an important source of uncertainty in assessments of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and emphasize that model predictions should be interpreted in policy-guiding applications along with a full appreciation of uncertainty.},

The book will be useful to statisticians, epidemiologists, and graduate students working in the area of air pollution and health and others analyzing similar data. The authors describe the different existing approaches to statistical modeling and cover basic aspects of analyzing and understanding air pollution and health data. The case studies in each chapter demonstrate how to use R to apply and interpret different statistical models and to explore the effects of potential confounding factors. A working knowledge of R and regression modeling is assumed. In-depth knowledge of R programming is not required to understand and run the examples. Researchers in this area will find the book useful as a {``}live{''} reference. Software for all of the analyses in the book is downloadable from the web and is available under a Free Software license. The reader is free to run the examples in the book and modify the code to suit their needs. In addition to providing the software for developing the statistical models, the authors provide the entire database from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) in a convenient R package. With the database, readers can run the examples and experiment with their own methods and ideas.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Climates are changing rapidly, producing warm climate conditions globally not previously observed in modern history. Malaria is of great concern as a cause of human mortality and morbidity, particularly across Africa, thanks in large part to the presence there of a particularly competent suite of mosquito vector species. Methods: I derive spatially explicit estimates of human populations living in regions newly suitable climatically for populations of two key Anopheles gambiae vector complex species in Africa over the coming 50 years, based on ecological niche model projections over two global climate models, two scenarios of climate change, and detailed spatial summaries of human population distributions. Results: For both species, under all scenarios, given the changing spatial distribution of appropriate conditions and the current population distribution, the models predict a reduction of 11.3-30.2% in the percentage of the overall population living in areas climatically suitable for these vector species in coming decades, but reductions and increases are focused in different regions: malaria vector suitability is likely to decrease in West Africa, but increase in eastern and southern Africa. Conclusion: Climate change effects on African malaria vectors shift their distributional potential from west to east and south, which has implications for overall numbers of people exposed to these vector species. Although the total is reduced, malaria is likely to pose novel public health problems in areas where it has not previously been common. },

The general framework focuses on interactions among abiotic requirements, biotic constraints, and dispersal abilities of species as determinants of distributional areas. Disease transmission systems have key differences from other sorts of biological phenomena: Interactions among species are particularly important, interactions may be stable or unstable, abiotic conditions may be relatively less important in shaping disease distributions, and dispersal abilities may be quite variable. The ways in which these differences may influence disease transmission geography are complex; I illustrate their effects by means of worked examples regarding West Nile Virus, plague, filoviruses, and yellow fever. },

I present evidence that neither idea is valid, effectively arguing that environmental spaces are simpler than Stockwell envisages, but that more complex and dimensional models are necessary to describe species{'} ecological niches. Beyond these conceptual problems, WhyWhere suffers from several more practical problems, which render it little useful for any practical application. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Species{'} invasions have long been regarded as enormously complex processes, so complex as to defy predictivity. Phases of this process, however are emerging as highly predictable: the potential geographic course of an invasion can be anticipated with high precision based on the ecological niche characteristics of a species in its native geographic distributional area. This predictivity depends on the premise that ecological niches constitute long-term stable constraints on the potential geographic distributions of species, for which a sizeable body of evidence is accumulating. Hence, although the entire invasion process is indeed complex, the geographic course that invasions are able to take can be anticipated with considerable confidence.},

Most of the predicted geographic extent of Ebola HF appear to have been observed; Marburg HF has the potential to occur farther south and east. Ecologic conditions appropriate for Ebola HF are also present in Southeast Asia and the Philippines, where Ebola Reston is hypothesized to be distributed.

  Abstract                 = {The development of quantitative models of species{'} distributions has largely ignored the potential for intraspecific variation in species{'} niche requirements. Application of such models may nevertheless provide a rich, untapped opportunity to address the basic issue of niche conservatism vs. evolution. We illustrate this potential using genetic algorithms coupled with geographical information systems, which provide a powerful and novel approach to characterizing species{'} ecological niches and, geographical distributions. Our example consists of several species of Mexican birds with recognized subspecies, and associated climatic and vegetation data. Our basic protocol is to develop an ecological niche model for each subspecies, and use this model to predict distributions of other subspecies. In some cases, the ecological niche model inferred for one subspecies provides an excellent descriptor of other subspecies{'} ranges, whereas in other cases the prediction is rather poor. We suggest that the latter may reveal the potential existence of evolved, intraspecific niche differentiation. We discuss alternative, non-evolutionary explanations, and point out potential implications of our results for predictive models of species{'} invasions.},

Model results permitted a reinterpretation of the geographic point of infection in the initiation of the 1975 cases in Zimbabwe, and also anticipated the potential for cases in Angola, where a large outbreak recently (2004-2005) occurred. The geographic potential for additional outbreaks is outlined, including in several countries in which the virus is not known.

Although the general geographic distributions of these epidemiologically important species are known, the spatiotemporal variation in their emergence and activity remains poorly understood. We used ecological niche modeling via a genetic algorithm to produce time-specific predictive models of monthly distributions of. Aedes aegypti in Mexico in 1995. Significant predictions of monthly mosquito activity and distributions indicate that predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of disease vector species is feasible; significant coincidence with human cases of dengue indicate that these dynamics probably translate directly into transmission of dengue virus to humans. This approach provides new potential for optimizing use of resources for disease prevention and remediation via automated forecasting of disease transmission risk.

Here, we use ecological niche modeling and general circulation model outputs to estimate future potential geographic distributions of 111 Canadian butterfly species. We develop future estimates under two emission scenarios from each of two climate change modeling centers; future projections for biodiversity are not only scenario dependent (more severe emission scenarios produce more severe effects on species{'} distributions) but also model dependent (the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis results were more severe than the Hadley Centre results). One interesting feature is the appearance of disjunctions in species{'} distributions, hence creating "vicariant events" over very short time periods. In general, however, a cost of 1%-3% additional loss of species{'} distributions is associated with more severe scenarios of emissions and climate change, suggesting that subtle biodiversity consequences are associated with the different climate futures debated in political circles.},

Location Ecological niche models were developed on the species{'} native distributional area in South America, and projected globally. Methods We developed ecological niche models based on six different environmental data sets, and compared their respective abilities to anticipate the North American invasive distributional area of the species. Results We show that models based on the {'}bioclimatic variables{'} of the WorldClim data set indeed fail to predict the full invasive potential of the species, but that models based on four other data sets could predict this potential correctly. Main conclusions The difference in predictive abilities appears to centre on the complexity of the environmental variables involved. These results emphasize important influences of environmental data sets on the generality and ability of ecological niche models to anticipate novel phenomena, and offer a simpler explanation for the lack of predictive ability among native and invaded distributional areas than that of niche shifts.},

Nevertheless, in spite of modelling efforts focused on single species(2) or entire ecosystems(5), a few preliminary surveys of fauna-wide effects(6,7), and evidence of climate change-mediated shifts in several species(8,9), the likely effects of climate change on species{'} distributions remain little known, and fauna-wide or community-level effects are almost completely unexplored(6). Here, using a genetic algorithm and museum specimen occurrence data, we develop ecological niche models for 1,870 species occurring in Mexico and project them onto two climate surfaces modelled for 2055.

An earlier effort prioritized mammalian taxa as to their possible status as the long-term coevolved reservoir of the filoviruses based on a coarse, regional classification of occurrences; here, we greatly refine the geographic data set for the mammalian taxa based on rich occurrence data sets and range interpolations from ecological niche models for each species involved. This improved detail permits a much more detailed inspection of distributional overlap patterns, and consequently a shorter list of candidate taxa-geographic analysis of 124 mammalian clades led to identification of 55 groups of interest that coincide spatially with known filovirus outbreaks, and fulfill the requirements of several additional assumptions. We discuss implications of our results for the search for the filovirus reservoir, and for research in African mammalogy.},

The results were strikingly different between the two algorithms - Maxent models reconstructed the overall distributions of the species at low thresholds, but higher predictive levels of Maxent predictions reflected overfitting to the input data; GARP models, on the other hand, succeeded in anticipating most of the species{'} distributional potential, at the cost of increased (apparent, at least) commission error. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) tests were weak in discerning models able to predict into broad unsampled areas from those that were not. Such transferability is clearly a novel challenge for modeling algorithms, and requires different qualities than does predicting within densely sampled landscapes - in this case, Maxent was transferable only at very low thresholds, and biases and gaps in input data may frequently affect results based on higher Maxent thresholds, requiring careful interpretation of model results.},

ROC has the advantage of being threshold-independent, and as such does not require decisions regarding thresholds of what constitutes a prediction of presence versus a prediction of absence. However, we show that, comparing two ROCS, using the AUC systematically undervalues models that do not provide predictions across the entire spectrum of proportional areas in the study area. Current ROC approaches in ecological niche modeling applications are also inappropriate because the two error components are weighted equally. We recommend a modification of ROC that remedies these problems, using partial-area ROC approaches to provide a firmer foundation for evaluation of predictions from ecological niche models. A worked example demonstrates that models that are evaluated favorably by traditional ROC AUCs are not necessarily the best when niche modeling considerations are incorporated into the design of the test.

In essentially all tests, both within states, among states, between years, and across the region, we found high predictivity of WNV case distributions, suggesting that one or more elements in the WNV transmission cycle has a strong ecological determination. Areas in the geographic region included in this study predicted as suitable for WNV transmission tended to have lower values of the vegetation indices in the summer months, pointing to consistent ecological differences between suitable and unsuitable areas.

We evaluated the dimensions of this potential invasion by using ecological niche models based on point-occurrence data. With these tools, we developed models with significant predictions for the native distributions of both Spotted and Barred owls (tested via independent occurrence data) and for the invasive range of Barred Owls. Overlap between the models for the two species suggests that most of the northern portion of the Spotted Owl{'}s distribution (south to about lest. 38degreesN) is vulnerable to Barred Owl invasion.

As an illustration, we analyzed 11 endemic Corvidae (jays) in Mexico; the method is applicable to any species for which distributional information exists and any region for which multitemporal land-cover information has been developed.

This new tool provides a large-scale perspective on species{'} geographic distributions, ecological and historical factors determining them, and their potential for change with expected environmental changes. As a first step, the ability of this technique to predict geographic distributions of the three species was tested statistically using two subsampling techniques: a random-selection technique that simulates 50% data density, and a quadrant-based technique that challenges the method to predict into broad unsampled regions. Predictivity under both test schemes was highly statistically significant. Visualisation of ecological niches provided insights into the ecological basis for distributional differences among species. Projections of potential geographic distributions across scenarios of global climate change suggested that only Lutzomyia whitmani is likely to be experiencing dramatic improvements in conditions in south-eastern Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis appears to be re-emerging; Lutzomyia intermedia and Lutzomyia migonei may be seeing more subtle improvements in climatic conditions, but the implications are not straightforward.

Although each of these themes has seen considerable attention in the modeling and forecasting communities, their joint effects remain little explored and poorly understood. We developed ecological niche models for 1804 species from the European flora, which we projected globally to identify areas of potential distribution, both at present and across 4 scenarios of future (2055) climates. As expected from previous studies, projections based on the CGCM1 climate model were more extreme than those based on the HadCM3 model, and projections based on the a2 emissions scenario were more extreme than those based on the b2 emissions scenario. However, less expected were the highly nonlinear and contrasting projected changes in distributional areas among continents: increases in distributional potential in Europe often corresponded with decreases on other continents, and species seeing expanding potential on one continent often saw contracting potential on others. In conclusion, global climate change will have complex effects on invasive potential of plant species.

  Abstract                 = {West Nile Virus has spread more rapidly than expected in the Western Hemisphere. We tested Culex mosquitoes and long-distance migratory birds as potential agents of spread for the virus, using a series of techniques, as follows. (1) Mosquito vector distributions were modeled using an ecological niche modeling approach (GARP) to produce a map of suitability of the landscape for mosquito transmission of the virus. (2) Simulations of spread were developed with an algorithm originally developed for modeling the spread of wildfires (EMBYR), seeding an initial presence of the virus in the New York City area. (3) Alternative spread scenarios were developed as (a) just mosquitoes as movement agents (spread simulation seeded once at New York City and allowed to spread across the mosquito suitability surface), versus (b) spread via mosquitoes on local scales in tandem with long-distance colonization with migratory birds as movement agents (spread simulation seeded once at New York City, and again at sites sampled from the winter destinations of birds breeding in southeastern New York State). The first scenario (mosquitoes only) did not coincide with observed patterns of spread, whereas the second (mosquitoes and migratory birds) coincided closely, suggesting that observed patterns of spread are best explained with migratory birds as critical long-distance transport agents; the virus, in regions to which it is transported by migratory birds, then is transmitted enzootically via mosquitoes. Similar simulations of spread were used to predict extensions of the virus in the Western Hemisphere in coming years.},

  Abstract                 = {Asian populations of gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), remain poorly characterized - indeed, they are not presently accorded any formal taxonomic status within the broader species. Their ecology is similarly largely uncharacterized in the literature, except by assumption that it will resemble that of European populations. We developed ecological niche models specific to Asian populations of the species, which can in turn be used to identify a potential geographic distributional area for the species. We demonstrated statistically significant predictivity of distributional patterns within the East Asian range of these populations; projecting the Asian ecological niche model to Europe, correspondence with European distributions was generally good, although some differences may exist; projecting the ecological niche model globally, we characterized a likely potential invasive distribution of this set of populations across the temperate zone of both Northern and Southern Hemisphere.},

Whenever possible it is shown how to compute estimates and forecasts in closed form; for more complex models, simulation techniques are used. A final chapter covers modern sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. The book illustrates all the fundamental steps needed to use dynamic linear models in practice, using R. Many detailed examples based on real data sets are provided to show how to set up a specific model, estimate its parameters, and use it for forecasting.

  Abstract                 = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species{'} range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Habitat destruction has driven many once-contiguous animal populations into remnant patches of varying size and isolation. The underlying framework for the conservation of fragmented populations is founded on the principles of island biogeography, wherein the probability of species occurrence in habitat patches varies as a function of patch size and isolation. Despite decades of research, the general importance of patch area and isolation as predictors of species occupancy in fragmented terrestrial systems remains unknown because of a lack of quantitative synthesis. Here, we compile occupancy data from 1,015 bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian, and invertebrate population networks on 6 continents and show that patch area and isolation are surprisingly poor predictors of occupancy for most species. We examine factors such as improper scaling and biases in species representation as explanations and find that the type of land cover separating patches most strongly affects the sensitivity of species to patch area and isolation. Our results indicate that patch area and isolation are indeed important factors affecting the occupancy of many species, but properties of the intervening matrix should not be ignored. Improving matrix quality may lead to higher conservation returns than manipulating the size and configuration of remnant patches for many of the species that persist in the aftermath of habitat destruction.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The field of ecological niche modelling or species distribution modelling has seen enormous activity and attention in recent years, in the light of exciting biological inferences that can be drawn from correlational models of species{'} environmental requirements (i.e. ecological niches) and inferences of potential geographic distributions. Among the many methods used in the field, one or two are in practice assumed to be {`}best{'} and are used commonly, often without explicit testing. 2. We explore herein implications of the {`}no free lunch{'} theorem, which suggests that no single optimization approach will prove to be best under all circumstances: we developed diverse virtual species with known niche and dispersal properties to test a suite of niche modelling algorithms designed to estimate potential areas of distribution. 3. The result was that (i) indeed, no single {`}best{'} algorithm was found and (ii) different algorithms performing very different manners depending on the particularities of the virtual species. 4. The conclusion is that niche or distribution modelling studies should begin by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the particular circumstances of the study and choose an algorithm for a particular challenge based on the results of those tests. Studies that do not take this step may use algorithms that are not optimal for that particular challenge.},

Validations of the resulting maps indicated that the niche-modeling approach yields a useful picture of aquatic bird species distributions in the country. Richness patterns among aquatic birds differ from those for landbirds: species richness is concentrated in coastal areas, but endemism is focused in the Transvolcanic Belt and the Altiplano. Place prioritization exercises identified sets of areas that would maximize the protection of this diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the importance of tropical biodiversity(1), informative species distributional data are seldom available for biogeographical study or setting conservation priorities(2,3). Modelling ecological niche distributions of species offers a potential soluion(4-7); however, the utility of old locality data from museums, and of more recent remotely sensed satellite data, remains poorly explored, especially for rapidly changing tropical landscapes. Using 29 modern data sets of environmental land coverage and 621 chameleon occurrence localities from Madagascar ( historical and recent), here we demonstrate a significant ability of our niche models in predicting species distribution. At 11 recently inventoried sites, highest predictive success (85.1%) was obtained for models based only on modern occurrence data (74.7% and 82.8% predictive success, respectively, for pre-1978 and all data combined). Notably, these models also identified three intersecting areas of over-prediction that recently yielded seven chameleon species new to science. We conclude that ecological niche modelling using recent locality records and readily available environmental coverage data provides informative biogeographical data for poorly known tropical landscapes, and offers innovative potential for the discovery of unknown distributional areas and unknown species.},

The ecology of this pathogen is poorly understood, in part because it has been extremely difficult to identify the niche(s) it occupies based on culture isolation of the organism from environmental samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the ecology of blastomycosis by performing maximum entropy modeling of exposure sites from 156 cases of human and canine blastomycosis to provide a regional-scale perspective of the geographic and ecologic distribution of B. dermatitidis in Wisconsin. Based on analysis with climatic, topographic, surface reflectance and other environmental variables, we predicted that ecologic conditions favorable for maintaining the fungus in nature occur predominantly within northern counties and counties along the western shoreline of Lake Michigan. Areas of highest predicted occurrence were often in proximity to waterways, especially in northcentral Wisconsin, where incidence of infection is highest. Ecologic conditions suitable for B. dermatitidis are present in urban and rural environments, and may differ at the extremes of distribution of the species in the state. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide a framework for a more informed search for specific environmental factors modulating B. dermatitidis occurrence and transmission and will be useful for improving public health awareness of relative exposure risks.},

  Abstract                 = {Few books on statistical data analysis in the natural sciences are written at a level that a non-statistician will easily understand. This is a book written in colloquial language, avoiding mathematical formulae as much as possible, trying to explain statistical methods using examples and graphics instead. To use the book efficiently, readers should have some computer experience. The book starts with the simplest of statistical concepts and carries readers forward to a deeper and more extensive understanding of the use of statistics in environmental sciences. The book concerns the application of statistical and other computer methods to the management, analysis and display of spatial data. These data are characterised by including locations (geographic coordinates), which leads to the necessity of using maps to display the data and the results of the statistical methods. Although the book uses examples from applied geochemistry, and a large geochemical survey in particular, the principles and ideas equally well apply to other natural sciences, e.g., environmental sciences, pedology, hydrology, geography, forestry, ecology, and health sciences/epidemiology. The book is unique because it supplies direct access to software solutions (based on R, the Open Source version of the S-language for statistics) for applied environmental statistics. For all graphics and tables presented in the book, the R-scripts are provided in the form of executable R-scripts. In addition, a graphical user interface for R, called DAS+R, was developed for convenient, fast and interactive data analysis. Statistical Data Analysis Explained: Applied Environmental Statistics with R provides, on an accompanying website, the software to undertake all the procedures discussed, and the data employed for their description in the book.},

Aphelocoma evolutionary history, nevertheless, has been the subject of two papers reaching opposite conclusions, even though they were based on the same allozyme data set. Herein, we present a second molecular data set - 500 bases of the ND2 gene - and analyse it cladistically to arrive at a new hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Recent hypotheses by other investigators of a hybrid origin of Aphelocoma populations are strongly contradicted. The ecological context within which these evolutionary processes are taking place is characterized using new tools for modelling ecological niches of species along a spectrum from humid tropical to dry temperate habitats. Evolutionary patterns of ecological niches are shown to consist of drastic departures from rate-uniformity and ecological niche conservatism. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London.},

For some systems, simple controlled experiments can be employed to reveal part of the complexity; often, however, observational studies that incorporate a multitude of causal factors may be the only (or preferred) avenue of study. We assess the value of recently advocated approaches to inference in both contexts. Specifically, we examine the use of information theoretic (IT) model selection using Akaike{'}s information criterion (AIC). We find that, for simple analyses, the advantages of switching to an IT-AIC approach are likely to be slight, especially given recent emphasis on biological rather than statistical significance. By contrast, the model selection approach embodied by IT approaches offers significant advantages when applied to problems of more complex causality. Model averaging is an intuitively appealing extension to model selection. However, we were unable to demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction accuracy when using model averaging with IT-AIC; our equivocal results suggest that more research is needed on its utility. We illustrate our arguments with worked examples from behavioural experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Prevention is the best way to slow the escalation of problems associated with biological invasions. Screening of potential introductions is widely applied for assessing the risk of species becoming invasive. Despite advances in the understanding of the determinants of invasiveness, screening still relies heavily on assessments of the potential of species to {'}fit in{'} to the broad environmental conditions of a target region. Most screening systems ask whether species are native to, or are known to be naturalized or invasive in, regions with {'}similar{'} climatic/environmental conditions to the target region. The level of similarity required to make the species a high-risk introduction is generally not specified. This paper describes a protocol for making such assessments more objective, using South Africa as a test case. Using nonparametric niche-based modelling (generalized additive model; GAM) calibrated on the current distribution of each South African biome, we mapped regions of the world that are climatically similar to South African biomes. Lists were produced of countries with the largest areas climatically similar to South Africa overall, and to each biome separately. Validation of the usefulness of the approach was sought by evaluating whether the main invasive plant species in South African biomes occur naturally, or have adventive ranges, in regions mapped as analogous to South African biomes. A very large part of the world is climatically similar to South Africa, with eight countries having larger areas of land classified as climatically similar to South African biomes than the total area of South Africa. Almost all the most prominent invasive species in South African biomes occur naturally or are invasive outside their natural range in areas with similar climates to those that occur in parts of South Africa. This confirms the value of objective climate matching in screening protocols. We examined climatic conditions for a representative sample of major invasive plants from other parts of the world. The analysis identified several species that are already invasive in regions that have matched climates in South Africa but that are not yet introduced or, if already present, have not yet invaded large areas. For example, the following known invasive species should be considered high-risk species in South African grasslands: Alliaria petiolata, Cytisus scoparius, Gleditsia triacanthos, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Hieracium pilosella, Juniperus communis, Pinus contorta, P. monticola, P. ponderosa, P. sylvestris, Prunus laurcerasus, and P. serotina. Objectively matched climatic regions are also useful as a first-cut assessment when evaluating species with no invasive history.},

Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the "effective isolation" of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.},

Currently, R offers a wide range of functionality for nonlinear regression analysis, but the relevant functions, packages and documentation are scattered across the R environment. This book provides a coherent and unified treatment of nonlinear regression with R by means of examples from a diversity of applied sciences such as biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine and toxicology. The book starts out giving a basic introduction to fitting nonlinear regression models in R. Subsequent chapters explain the salient features of the main fitting function nls(), the use of model diagnostics, how to deal with various model departures, and carry out hypothesis testing. In the final chapter grouped-data structures, including an example of a nonlinear mixed-effects regression model, are considered.},

Aimed at applied researchers and graduate students, this text provides a comprehensive overview of the framework of random effects joint models. Emphasis is given on applications such that readers will obtain a clear view on the type of research questions that are best answered using a joint modeling approach, the basic features of these models, and how they can be extended in practice. Special mention is given in checking the assumptions using residual plots, and on dynamic predictions for the survival and longitudinal outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = { Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician{'}s toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer{'}s point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

  Abstract                 = {Models used to predict species{'} potential distributions have been described as either correlative or mechanistic. We attempted to determine whether correlative models could perform as well as mechanistic models for predicting species potential distributions, using a case study. We compared potential distribution predictions made for a coastal dune plant (Scaevola plumieri) along the coast of South Africa, using a mechanistic model based on summer water balance (SWB), and two correlative models (a profile and a group discrimination technique). The profile technique was based on principal components analysis (PCA) and the group-discrimination technique was based on multiple logistic regression (LR). Kappa (kappa) statistics were used to objectively assess model performance and model agreement. Model performance was calculated by measuring the levels of agreement (using kappa) between a set of testing localities (distribution records not used for model building) and each of the model predictions. Using published interpretive guidelines for the kappa statistic, model performance was "excellent" for the SWB model (kappa = 0.852), perfect for the LR model (kappa = 1.000), and "very good" for the PCA model (kappa = 0.721). Model agreement was calculated by measuring the level of agreement between the mechanistic model and the two correlative models. There was "good" model agreement between the SWB and PCA models (kappa = 0.679) and "very good" agreement between the SWB And LR models (kappa = 0.786). The results suggest that correlative models can perform as well as or better than simple mechanistic models. The predictions generated from these three modelling designs are likely to generate different insights into the potential distribution and biology of the target organism and may be appropriate in different situations. The choice of model is likely to be influenced by the aims of the study, the biology of the target organism, the level of knowledge the target organism{'}s biology, and data quality.

All the tools are introduced in the context of real forestry datasets, which provide compelling examples of practical applications. The modeling challenges covered within the book include imputation and interpolation for spatial data, fitting probability density functions to tree measurement data using maximum likelihood, fitting allometric functions using both linear and non-linear least-squares regression, and fitting growth models using both linear and non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The coverage also includes deploying and using forest growth models written in compiled languages, analysis of natural resources and forestry inventory data, and forest estate planning and optimization using linear programming. The book would be ideal for a one-semester class in forest biometrics or applied statistics for natural resources management.

  Abstract                 = {Sierra Madre Sparrows (Xenospiza baileyi) are among the least known of all bird species in Mexico. Recent surveys have discovered previously unknown populations and the current known distribution of Sierra Madre Sparrows consists of two populations separated by \textgreater800 km. We used available distributional information to develop ecological niche models that (1) predict much of the distribution potential of the species, (2) establish that the broad disjunction separating the two populations has ecological correlates that appear to be important to the distributional of these sparrows, and (3) illustrate the extremely restricted ecological distribution of the species. We used two sets of climatic and topographic variables, with one including all 22 variables available and the second with only six variables that were positively related to quality of distributional models. Although indications of differences between the two sets of populations were found based on the full 22-dimensional environmental dataset, such a highly dimensional analysis is vulnerable to over-fitting; models based on the reduced dataset indicated that the two populations occur in areas with similar ecological conditions. Our models also suggest that southern population of Sierra Madre Sparrows covers most of their potential range in that region. The potential range of the northern population, however, extends beyond known points of occurrence.

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the different background landscapes in which malaria transmission occurs is fundamental to understanding malaria epidemiology and to designing effective local malaria control programs. Geology, geomorphology, vegetation, climate, land use, and anopheline distribution were used as a basis for an ecological classification of the state of Roraima, Brazil, in the northern Amazon Basin, focused on the natural history of malaria and transmission. We used unsupervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, and weighted overlay with equal contribution analyses to fine-scale thematic maps that resulted in clustered regions. We used ecological niche modeling techniques to develop a fine-scale picture of malaria vector distributions in the state. Eight ecoregions were identified and malaria-related aspects are discussed based on this classification, including 5 types of dense tropical rain forest and 3 types of savannah. Ecoregions formed by dense tropical rain forest were named as montane (ecoregion I), submontane (II), plateau (III), lowland (IV), and alluvial ( V). Ecoregions formed by savannah were divided into steppe ( VI, campos de Roraima), savannah (VII, cerrado), and wetland (VIII, campinarana). Such ecoregional mappings are important tools in integrated malaria control programs that aim to identify specific characteristics of malaria transmission, classify transmission risk, and define priority areas and appropriate interventions. For some areas, extension of these approaches to still-finer resolutions will provide an improved picture of malaria transmission patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter provides an introduction to plane compound wall jets. The chapter discusses the preliminary experimental observations related to it. If in a plane turbulent wall jet, the surrounding fluid is also in motion in the same direction, then this phenomenon is known as {``}the plane turbulent compound wall jet.{''} Such a wall jet is presented in a diagrammatic form, in which U1is the velocity of the surrounding fluid referred to as {``}the free stream.{''} The parameter affecting the flow is the ratio of the jet to the free-stream velocity. Velocity profiles for plane compound wall jets are discussed. Even though the profiles appear to be similar in the free-mixing region, there is a considerable departure from similarity in the boundary-layer region. The velocity profiles in the inner and outer regions are similar if considered separately. The chapter also discusses some of the available methods for predicting the characteristics of compound wall jets. \copyright 1976, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The claim of this article is that Bayesian inference is ideally suited to making adequate inferences. Specifically, Bayesian techniques based on {`}{'}noninformative{''} priors provide intuitive interpretations and extensions of familiar significance tests. The use of Bayesian inference for assessing importance is discussed elementarily by comparing 2 treatments, then by addressing hypotheses in complex analysis of variance designs.},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge for conservation assessments is to identify priority areas that incorporate biological patterns and processes. Because large-scale processes are mostly oriented along environmental gradients, we propose to accommodate them by designing regional-scale corridors to capture these gradients. Based on systematic conservation planning principles such as representation and persistence, we identified large tracts of untransformed land (i.e., conservation corridors) for conservation that would achieve biodiversity targets for pattern and process in the Subtropical Thicket Biome of South Africa. We combined least-cost path analysis with a target-driven algorithm to identify the best option for capturing key environmental gradients while considering biodiversity targets and conservation opportunities and constraints. We identified seven conservation corridors on the basis of subtropical thicket representation, habitat transformation and degradation, wildlife suitability, irreplaceability of vegetation types, protected area networks, and future land-use pressures. These conservation corridors covered 21.1% of the planning region (ranging from 600 to 5200 km(2)) and successfully achieved targets for biological processes and to a lesser extent for vegetation types. The corridors we identified are intended to promote the persistence of ecological processes (gradients and fixed processes) and fulfill half of the biodiversity pattern target. We compared the conservation corridors with a simplified corridor design consisting of a fixed-width buffer along major rivers. Conservation corridors outperformed river buffers in seven out of eight criteria. Our corridor design can provide a tool for quantifying trade-offs between various criteria (biodiversity pattern and process, implementation constraints and opportunities). A land-use management model was developed to facilitate implementation of conservation actions within these corridors.},

  Abstract                 = {Invasive species are known to influence the structure and function of invaded ecological communities, and preventive measures appear to be the most efficient means of controlling these effects. However, management of biological invasions requires use of adequate tools to understand and predict invasion patterns in recently introduced areas. The present study: (1) estimates the potential geographic distribution and ecological requirements of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr), one of the most conspicuous invasive species throughout the world, in the Iberian Peninsula using ecological niche modeling, and (2) provides new insights into the process of selection of consensual areas among predictions from several modeling methodologies. Ecological niche models were developed using 5 modeling techniques: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), generalized boosted models (GBM), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). Models for the eastern and western portions of the Iberian Peninsula were built using subsets of occurrence and environmental data to investigate the potential for ecological niche differences between the invading populations. Our results indicate geographic differences between predictions of different approaches, and the utility of ensemble predictions in identifying areas of uncertainty regarding the species{'} invasive potential. More generally, our models predict coastal areas and major river corridors as highly suitable for Argentine ants, and indicate that western and eastern Iberian Peninsula populations occupy similar environmental conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Determining the spread and potential geographical distribution of invasive species is integral to making invasion biology a predictive science. We assembled a dataset of over 1000 occurrences of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), one of the world{'}s worst invasive alien species. Native to central South America, Argentine ants are now found in many Mediterranean and subtropical climates around the world. We used this dataset to assess the species{'} potential geographical and ecological distribution, and to examine changes in its distributional potential associated with global climate change, using techniques for ecological niche modelling. Models developed were highly predictive of the species{'} overall range, including both the native distributional area and invaded areas worldwide. Despite its already widespread occurrence, L. humile has potential for further spread, with tropical coastal Africa and southeast Asia apparently vulnerable to invasion. Projecting ecological niche models onto four general circulation model scenarios of future (2050s) climates provided scenarios of the species{'} potential for distributional expansion with warming climates: generally, the species was predicted to retract its range in tropical regions, but to expand at higher latitude areas.},

Despite their widespread success, little is known about what makes an area susceptible-or not-to invasion. Here, we use a genetic algorithm approach to ecological niche modeling based on high-resolution remote-sensing data to examine the roles of niche similarity and difference in predicting invasions by this species.

  Abstract                 = {Deforestation threatens biodiversity conservation worldwide, but little quantitative information is available on how it affects individual species{'} distributions. We modeled potential distributions of 85 continental endemic Mexican mammal species using ecological niche modeling, and produced testable predictions of species{'} extant distributions by limiting ecological niches to remnant untransformed habitat based on the Inventario Nacional Forestal 2000. We included point occurrence data for all endemics only from collecting localities prior to 1970, before wide areas of habitat transformation occurred nationwide. Most endemics (61 of 85, 72%) showed a high proportion of transformed habitat (34.5%) at the national level. More than one-fourth of the endemics (23 out of 85, 27%) lost more than 50% of untransformed habitat within their potential distributions; two showed drastic areal loss of more than 90%; another two showed a loss of more than 80%. Only 34 of the endemics are listed as endangered or threatened in the Mexican Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM). No significant association existed between proportional loss and conservation status as assigned in the NOM, nor are correlations significant between original distributional area and area of remnant untransformed habitat. Both findings suggest that geographic location determines extinction risks rather than area per se. Endemics in the state of Veracruz and in the Transvolcanic Belt suffered the most drastic niche reductions and thus appear to be at high extinction risk from further deforestation.

  Abstract                 = {R is rapidly growing in popularity as the environment of choice for data analysis and graphics both in academia and industry. Lattice brings the proven design of Trellis graphics (originally developed for S by William S. Cleveland and colleagues at Bell Labs) to R, considerably expanding its capabilities in the process. Lattice is a powerful and elegant high level data visualization system that is sufficient for most everyday graphics needs, yet flexible enough to be easily extended to handle demands of cutting edge research. Written by the author of the lattice system, this book describes it in considerable depth, beginning with the essentials and systematically delving into specific low levels details as necessary. No prior experience with lattice is required to read the book, although basic familiarity with R is assumed. The book contains close to 150 figures produced with lattice. Many of the examples emphasize principles of good graphical design; almost all use real data sets that are publicly available in various R packages. All code and figures in the book are also available online, along with supplementary material covering more advanced topics.},

Statistics are probability statements about the reliability of associations. In public and journalistic debates about psychological topics, the need for statistical rules is evident. Anecdotes, intuitions, and sensational and unlikely events often dominate popular discussions. Psychological science demands that the probability of events and associations be evaluated by statistical means. Understanding of statistical tests can be improved by abandoning the term significance, which means reliability to psychologists, but in everyday English, means importance. The importance of a result depends on magnitude of association, nor on whether the event has a nonzero chance of recurring. Given large samples and multiple measures, statistical rests are used too often to draw misleading conclusions about the importance of research results. Better uses of statistics would focus on the magnitude of effects and error estimates.},

Meta-analysis methods can solve these problems{--}and have done so in some areas. However, meta-analysis represents more than merely a change in methods of data analysis. It requires major changes in the way psychologists view the general research process.

It is now possible to use meta-analysis to show that reliance on significance testing retards the development of cumulative knowledge. But reform of teaching and practice will also require that researchers learn that the benefits that they believe flow from use of significance testing are illusory. Teachers must revamp their courses to bring students to understand that (a) reliance on significance testing retards the growth of cumulative research knowledge; (b) benefits widely believed to flow from significance testing do not in fact exist; and (c) significance testing methods must be replaced with point estimates and confidence intervals in individual studies and with meta-analyses in the integration of multiple studies. This reform is essential to the future progress of cumulative knowledge in psychological research.},

  Abstract                 = {Global change will alter the supply of ecosystem services that are vital for human well-being. To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century, we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example, increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example, "surplus land" for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production). However, many changes increase vulnerability as a result of a decreasing supply of ecosystem services (for example, declining soil fertility, declining water availability, increasing risk of forest fires), especially in the Mediterranean and mountain regions.},

  Abstract                 = {1 Secondary seed dispersal by wind, the wind-driven movement of seeds along the ground surface, is an important dispersal mechanism for plant species in a range of environments. 2 We formulate a mechanistic model that describes how secondary dispersal by wind is affected by seed traits, wind conditions and obstacles to seed movement. The model simulates the movement paths of individual seeds and can be fully specified using independently measured parameters. 3 We develop an explicit version of the model that uses a spatially explicit representation of obstacle patterns, and also an aggregated version that uses probability distributions to model seed retention at obstacles and seed movement between obstacles. The aggregated version is computationally efficient and therefore suited to large-scale simulations. It provides a very good approximation of the explicit version (R-2 \textgreater 0.99) if initial seed positions vary randomly relative to the obstacle pattern. 4 To validate the model, we conducted a field experiment in which we released seeds of seven South African Proteaceae species that differ in seed size and morphology into an arena in which we systematically varied obstacle patterns. When parameterized with maximum likelihood estimates obtained from independent measurements, the explicit model version explained 70-77% of the observed variation in the proportion of seeds dispersed over 25 m and 67-69% of the observed variation in the direction of seed dispersal. 5 The model tended to underestimate dispersal rates, possibly due to the omission of turbulence from the model, although this could also be explained by imprecise estimation of one model parameter (the aerodynamic roughness length). 6 Our analysis of the aggregated model predicts a unimodal relationship between the distance of secondary dispersal by wind and seed size. The model can also be used to identify species with the potential for long-distance seed transport by secondary wind dispersal. 7 The validated model expands the domain of mechanistic dispersal models, contributes to a functional understanding of seed dispersal, and provides a tool for predicting the distances that seeds move. },

Here we test whether estimates of a species{'} evolutionary age, colonization and persistence ability can explain its current {'}range filling{'} (the ratio between realized and potential range size). Location Fynbos biome (Cape Floristic Region, South Africa). Methods For 37 species of woody plants (Proteaceae), we estimate range filling using atlas data and distribution models, evolutionary age using molecular phylogenies, and persistence ability using estimates of individual longevity (which determines the probability of extinction of local populations). Colonization ability is estimated from validated process-based seed dispersal models, the arrangement of potential habitat, and data on local abundance. To relate interspecific variation in range filling to evolutionary age, colonization and persistence ability, we use two complementary model types: phenomenological linear models and the process-based metapopulation model of Levins. Results Linear model analyses show that range filling increases with a species{'} colonization and persistence ability but is not affected by species age. Moreover, colonization ability is a better predictor of range filling than its component variables (local abundance and dispersal ability). The phylogenetically independent interaction between colonization and persistence ability is significant (P \textless 0.05) for 97% of 180 alternative phylogenies. While the selected linear model explains 42% of the variance in arcsine transformed range filling, the Levins model performs more poorly. It overestimates range filling for realistic parameter values and produces unrealistic parameter estimates when fitted statistically. Main conclusions. Colonization and local extinction seem to shape Proteaceae range dynamics on ecological rather than macroevolutionary time-scales. Our results suggest that the positive abundance-range size relationship in this group is due primarily to the effect of abundance on colonization. In summary, this study contributes to a process-based understanding of range dynamics and highlights the importance of colonization for the future survival of Fynbos Proteaceae.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the effect of habitat loss on the ability of trees to shift in distribution across a landscape dominated by agriculture. The potential distribution shifts of four tree species (Diospyros virginiana, Oxydendron arboreum, Pinus virginiana, Quercus falcata var. falcata) whose northern distribution limits fall in the southern third of Ohio were used to assess possible distribution shift scenarios as a result of global warming. Our predictions derive from the results of simulations using (a) forest inventory based estimates of current distribution and abundance of target species; (b) a satellite-based estimate of forest habitat availability; and (c) a tree migration model (SHIFT). The current distribution and abundance of trees was estimated using USDA Forest Service{'}s Forest Inventory Analysis data and distribution maps from the late 1960s; pre-European settlement forest-nonforest maps were used to represent the fully forested condition for calibration and comparison. Habitat-availability estimates in Ohio were estimated using classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data from 1994. Tree abundance, forest availability and migration were modeled using a 1-km(2) pixel size. Forest availability was estimated as the proportion of forested TM pixels within each cell. The probability of a migrating species colonizing an unoccupied cell is modeled as a function of forest availability and distance to occupied cells. The results of the migration models suggest that the species studied are capable of colonizing virtually any forested location within Ohio over the next 100 years if climatic controls over the current distribution that may currently inhibit northward movement are relaxed. The contiguous distribution of these species, however, is not likely to shift more than 10 km during the next century regardless of the magnitude of the climate change. Examining the sensitivity of our simulations by varying critical model attributes, we found that whereas the variables controlling the amount of long-distance dispersal have strong effects on migration rates in the fully forested 1800 situation, they have significantly lesser effects on projections of future migration into highly fragmented forests. The low forest availability that characterizes much of the current Ohio landscape, along with the low likelihood of long distance dispersal, result in potential distribution shifts that are concentrated within the principally forested corridors in southeastern Ohio. We propose that in contrast to the past, future tree migrations are likely to be spatially and temporally correlated as a result of large climatic forcing and channelization through limited regions of available habitat. With respect to the management of biodiversity, this result suggests that it may be very difficult to discern plant migrations of native forest species owing to exceedingly slow rates of movement.},

We evaluated the role of these factors in 14 codistributed species of reptiles and amphibians on the Indonesian island of Halmahera by testing whether their molecular variation was correlated with geographic distance, ecology, riverine barriers, or Halmahera{'}s paleoisland precursors. We found support for isolation by distance effects in four species. Two of these four were also significantly affected either by rivers or by ecology. A fifth species was significantly affected by ecology and a sixth was significantly affected by Halmahera{'}s paleoislands. [Correction added after publication 9 December 2009: the previous sentence was edited for clarity.] These findings-the most comprehensive survey of multispecies genetic variation on Halmahera to date-bode well for the efficacy of the recently established Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park in conserving a substantial component of vertebrate genetic variation on this island. Future success of conservation efforts will depend crucially, of course, on funding for and enforcement of conservation management of this park. },

Statistical significance does not speak to the probability that the null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is true or false, to the probability that a result would be replicated, or to treatment effects, nor is it a valid indicator of the magnitude or the importance of a result. The persistence of statistical significance testing is due to many subtle factors. Journal editors are not to blame, but as publishing gatekeepers they could diminish its dysfunctional use.},

When weaknesses in the model are identified, the next step is to address each of these weaknesses. A key theme throughout the book is that it makes sense to base inferences or conclusions only on valid models. The regression output and plots that appear throughout the book have been generated using R. On the book website you will find the R code used in each example in the text. You will also find SAS code and STATA code to produce the equivalent output on the book website. Primers containing expanded explanations of R, SAS and STATA and their use in this book are also available on the book website. The book contains a number of new real data sets from applications ranging from rating restaurants, rating wines, predicting newspaper circulation and magazine revenue, comparing the performance of NFL kickers, and comparing finalists in the Miss America pageant across states. One of the aspects of the book that sets it apart from many other regression books is that complete details are provided for each example. The book is aimed at first year graduate students in statistics and could also be used for a senior undergraduate class.},

  Abstract                 = {Global climate warming, now conclusively linked to anthropogenically-increased CO2 levels in the earth{'}s atmosphere, has already had impacts on the earth{'}s biodiversity and is predicted to threaten more than 1 million species with extinction by 2050. Climate change in southern Africa is expected to involve higher temperatures and lower rainfall, with less predictability and a greater frequency of severe storms, fires and El Nino events. The predicted changes to birds in Africa - the continent most at risk from climate. change - have hardly been explored, yet birds and many other vertebrates face uncertain futures. Here, in one of the first focused analyses of the correlates of climate change vulnerability in southern African birds, we offer a wideranging perspective on which species may be most at risk, and explore which traits may influence the adaptability of extinction risk of bird species. Our review suggests that small nomadic species with short generation times may be least at risk. While larger-bodied species may be physiologically buffered against environmental change, their longer generation times may make them less able to adapt evolutionarily to climate change. Migrant species, and those with specialised feeding niches such as pollinators, are also predicted to be at risk of population declines, based on low ability to adapt to new environments when introduced there as aliens. Species with small ranges (\textless50 000km(2)) restricted to the two southern African biodiversity hotspots most at risk from climate change - the Cape Floral Kingdom and the Succulent Karoo - are ranked according to low, medium or high risk of extinction. Those restricted to mountain slopes, mountain tops or islands, and those occurring mainly at the southern or western extremes of these biomes, are ranked as highest risk. These include endemic sunbirds, warblers and rock-jumpers - none of which are currently recognised Red Data species. Using climate envelopes we modelled the possible range shifts by 2050 of three pairs of species found in habitats considered to be at risk: fynbos, mountain and and Karoo. All six species lost substantial portions of their range (x = 40%), with the montane Drakensberg Rock-jumper Chaetops aurantius losing most (69%). Significant reductions of available climate space in all species may interact with life history characteristics to threaten many southern African bird species unable to shift geographic range or adapt to novel resource conditions. We conclude with a list of research priorities and testable hypotheses which may advance our understanding of the complex influence that climate change is likely to have on African, particularly southern African, birds. },

  Abstract                 = {A predator{'}s per capita feeding rate on prey, or its functional response, provides a foundation for predator-prey theory. Since 1959, Holling{'}s prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator-prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator-prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator-prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms., we suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high.},

We discuss correction formulas developed to attenuate statistical bias in ME estimates and illustrate the effect these formulas have on different sample and effect sizes. Finally, we discuss several cautions against the indiscriminate use of these statistics and offer reasons why ME statistics, like all substantive result interpretation aids, are useful only when their strengths and limitations are understood by researchers.},

Using a single term (SDM) to denote diverse objectives and practices does not help to clarify issues; I discuss this point.

  Abstract                 = {Mathematics plays an important role in many scientific and engineering disciplines. This book deals with the numerical solution of differential equations, a very important branch of mathematics. Our aim is to give a practical and theoretical account of how to solve a large variety of differential equations, comprising ordinary differential equations, initial value problems and boundary value problems, differential algebraic equations, partial differential equations and delay differential equations. The solution of differential equations using R is the main focus of this book. It is therefore intended for the practitioner, the student and the scientist, who wants to know how to use R for solving differential equations. However, it has been our goal that non-mathematicians should at least understand the basics of the methods, while obtaining entrance into the relevant literature that provides more mathematical background. Therefore, each chapter that deals with R examples is preceded by a chapter where the theory behind the numerical methods being used is introduced. In the sections that deal with the use of R for solving differential equations, we have taken examples from a variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, pharmacokinetics. Many examples are well-known test examples, used frequently in the field of numerical analysis.},

I dispute this by pointing out that the Type II error rate may be as high as 1 - alpha. Falk (1998) defends Bayesian inference, which was impugned by me. She also makes a case for the use of replications for the purpose of testing hypotheses. I complain that the supporters of Bayesian inference have not explained adequately what its purpose or role in science is, and for this reason it is an impediment to understanding in this area. I also dispute Falk{'}s view of the role of replications in that I would require a successful replication to be one that produces an effect that is clearly discernible, meaning the effect is consistently noticeable with the aid of nothing more than descriptive statistics.},

The most visible argument that SS is not an index of replicability, one that is based in notions of Bayesian statistical inference, is considered and shown to be flawed. Two different arguments are presented that demonstrate the irrelevance of SS to replicability: (a) SS may not be taken as a sign of the truth of the research hypothesis; and (b) statistical significance tests do not generate verifiable predictions of replication attempts. Direct tests of replicability and effect-size measures of replicability are shown to have comparable problems. A solution to the replicability problem is proposed for atheoretical research that replaces {`}once-and-for-all{'} tests of replicability with the requirement that the treatment effect be demonstrable (a) in the individual (b) on a continuing basis, and (c) in a way that is clearly discernible. The question of the role of significance testing in research is answered by denying a role to such testing.},

The difference between scientific activity, on the one hand, and literature study, on the other, is highlighted in the analyses. Both MA and empirical science are said to be misguided by a hypothesis-testing approach to science, which approach leads to an obliviousness with respect to mechanisms that underlie phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {Since its inception, R has become one of the preeminent programs for statistical computing and data analysis. The ready availability of the program, along with a wide variety of packages and the supportive R community make R an excellent choice for almost any kind of computing task related to statistics. However, many users, especially those with experience in other languages, do not take advantage of the full power of R. Because of the nature of R, solutions that make sense in other languages may not be very efficient in R. This book presents a wide array of methods applicable for reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that data. In addition to the built-in functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods presented take advantage of the core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided for common data management tasks. Most experienced R users discover that, especially when working with large data sets, it may be helpful to use other programs, notably databases, in conjunction with R. Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users with experience in other languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming constructs like loops are provided. Since many statistical modeling and graphics functions need their data presented in a data frame, techniques for converting the output of commonly used functions to data frames are provided throughout the book. Using a variety of examples based on data sets included with R, along with easily simulated data sets, the book is recommended to anyone using R who wishes to advance from simple examples to practical real-life data manipulation solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {The most common statistical pitfalls in ecological research are those associated with data exploration, the logic of sampling and design, and the interpretation of statistical results. Although one can find published errors in calculations, the majority of statistical pitfalls result from incorrect logic or interpretation despite correct numerical calculations. There are often simple solutions to avoiding these problems that require only patience, clarity of thinking, probabilistic insight, and a reduced reliance on out-of-the-box approaches. Some of these trouble spots are inherent to all statistical analyses and others are particularly insidious in ecology where true controls or replication are challenging, small sample sizes are common, and correctly linking mathematical constructs and ecological ideas is essential. Here we summarize the most common statistical pitfalls observed over nearly a century of combined consulting and research experience in ecological statistics. We provide short, simple solut...},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical power analysis can be used to increase the efficiency of research efforts and to clarify research results, Power analysis is most valuable in the design or planning phases of research efforts. Such prospective (a priori) power analyses can be used to guide research design and to estimate the number of samples necessary to achieve a high probability of detecting biologically significant effects. Retrospective (a posteriori) power analysis has been advocated as a method to increase information about hypothesis tests that were not rejected. However, estimating power for tests of null hypotheses that were not rejected with the effect size observed in the study is incorrect; these power estimates will always be less than or equal to 0.50 when bias adjusted and have no relation to true power. Therefore, retrospective power estimates based on the observed effect size for hypothesis tests that were not rejected are misleading; retrospective power estimates are only meaningful when based on effect sizes other than the observed effect size, such as those effect sizes hypothesized to be biologically significant. Retrospectively power analysis can be used effectively to estimate the number of samples or effect size that would have been necessary for a completed study to have rejected a specific null hypothesis. Simply presenting confidence intervals can provide additional information about null hypotheses that were not rejected, including information about the size of the true effect and whether or not there is adequate evidence to {`}{'}accept{''} a null hypothesis as true, We suggest that (1) statistical power analyses be routinely incorporated into research planning efforts to increase their efficiency; (2) confidence intervals be used in lieu of retrospective power analyses for null hypotheses that were not rejected to assess the likely size of the true effect, (3) minimum biologically significant effect sizes be used for all power analyses, and (4) if retrospective power estimates are to be reported, then the alpha-level, effect sizes, and sample sizes used in calculations must also be reported.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A major paradigm shift is occurring in the approach of ecologists to statistical analysis. The use of the traditional approach of null-hypothesis testing has been questioned and an alternative, model selection by information-theoretic methods, has been strongly promoted and is now widely used. For certain types of analysis, information-theoretic approaches offer powerful and compelling advantages over null-hypothesis testing. 2. The benefits of information-theoretic methods are often framed as criticisms of null-hypothesis testing. We argue that many of these criticisms are neither irremediable nor always fair. Many are criticisms of the paradigm{'}s application, rather than of its formulation. Information-theoretic methods are equally vulnerable to many such misuses. Care must be taken in the use of either approach but users of null-hypothesis tests, in particular, must greatly improve standards of reporting and interpretation. 3. Recent critiques have suggested that the distinction between experimental and observational studies defines the limits of the utility of null-hypothesis testing (with the paradigm being applicable to the former but not the latter). However, we believe that there are many situations in which observational data are collected that lend themselves to analysis under the null-hypothesis testing paradigm. We suggest that the applicability of the two analytical paradigms is more accurately defined by studies that assess univariate causality (when null-hypothesis testing is adequate) and those that assess multivariate patterns of causality (when information-theoretic methods are more suitable). 4. Synthesis and applications. Many ecologists are confused about the circumstances under which different inferential paradigms might apply. We address some of the major criticisms of the null-hypothesis testing paradigm, assess those criticisms in relation to the information-theoretic paradigm, propose methods for improving the use of null-hypothesis testing, and discuss situations in which the use of null-hypothesis testing would be appropriate. We urge instructors and practitioners of statistical methods to heighten awareness of the limitations of null-hypothesis testing and to use information-theoretic methods whenever prior evidence suggests that multiple research hypotheses are plausible. We contend, however, that by marginalizing the use of null-hypothesis testing, ecologists risk rejecting a powerful, informative and well-established analytical tool.},

Any well designed study can improve our understanding of biological systems, regardless of the inferential approach used. Nevertheless, an awareness of available techniques and their pitfalls could guide better approaches to data collection and broaden the range of questions that can be addressed. Although we should reduce our reliance on significance testing, it retains an important role in statistical education and is likely to remain fundamental to the falsification of scientific hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential. 2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management practices. 3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to be sensitive to agricultural management. 4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each, particularly with regard to available data. 5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their use. 6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds have largely outstripped the availability of data required to parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model development.},

The degree to which communities are nonanalogue appears to increase with greater time depth, and this progressive process is a necessary outcome of the individualistic response of species to climate change through time. In addition, it is noted that populations within species, as well as the species as a whole, respond individualistically. This paper proposes that many elements of nonanalogue communities are extinct populations, which may explain their environmentally anomalous combinations. These extinct populations are, by definition, lineages without descendents. It is further proposed that the differential extinction of populations, as a result of continuous ecological reassembly, could amount to a significant evolutionary phenomenon.},

  Abstract                 = {This book provides insight and practical illustrations on how modern statistical concepts and regression methods can be applied in medical prediction problems, including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Many advances have been made in statistical approaches towards outcome prediction, but these innovations are insufficiently applied in medical research. Old-fashioned, data hungry methods are often used in data sets of limited size, validation of predictions is not done or done simplistically, and updating of previously developed models is not considered. A sensible strategy is needed for model development, validation, and updating, such that prediction models can better support medical practice. Clinical prediction models presents a practical checklist with seven steps that need to be considered for development of a valid prediction model. These include preliminary considerations such as dealing with missing values; coding of predictors; selection of main effects and interactions for a multivariable model; estimation of model parameters with shrinkage methods and incorporation of external data; evaluation of performance and usefulness; internal validation; and presentation formats. The steps are illustrated with many small case-studies and R code, with data sets made available in the public domain. The book further focuses on generalizability of prediction models, including patterns of invalidity that may be encountered in new settings, approaches to updating of a model, and comparisons of centers after case-mix adjustment by a prediction model. The text is primarily intended for clinical epidemiologists and biostatisticians. It can be used as a textbook for a graduate course on predictive modeling in diagnosis and prognosis. It is beneficial if readers are familiar with common statistical models in medicine: linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox regression. The book is practical in nature. But it provides a philosophical perspective on data analysis in medicine that goes beyond predictive modeling. In this era of evidence-based medicine, randomized clinical trials are the basis for assessment of treatment efficacy. Prediction models are key to individualizing diagnostic and treatment decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Human interests often conflict with those of wildlife. In the coastal zone humans often exploit shellfish populations that would otherwise provide food for populations of shorebirds (Charadrii). There has been considerable debate on the consequences of shellfishing for the survival of shorebirds, and conversely the effects of shorebird predation on the shellfish stocks remaining for human exploitation. Until now, it has been difficult to determine the impact of current shellfishery practices on birds or to investigate how possible alternative policies would affect their survival and numbers. 2. One long-running contentious issue has been how to manage mussel Mytilus edulis and cockle Cerastoderma edule shellfisheries in a way that has least effect on a co-dependent shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, which also consumes these shellfish. This study used a behaviour-based model to explore the effects that the present-day management regimes of a mussel (Exe estuary, UK) and a cockle (Burry inlet, UK) fishery have on the survival and numbers of overwintering oystercatchers. It also explored how alternative regimes might affect the birds. 3. The model includes depletion and disturbance as two possibly detrimental effects of shellfishing and some of the longer-term effects on shellfish stocks. Importantly, model birds respond to shellfishing in the same ways as real birds. They increase the time spent feeding at low tide and feed in fields and upshore areas at other times. When shellfishing removes the larger prey, birds eat more smaller prey. 4. The results suggest that, currently, neither shellfishery causes oystercatcher mortality to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of shellfishing; at present intensities, shellfishing does not significantly affect the birds. However, they also show that changes in management practices, such as increasing fishing effort, reducing the minimum size of shellfish collected or increasing the daily quota, can greatly affect oystercatcher mortality and population size, and that the detrimental effect of shellfishing can be greatly increased by periods of cold weather or when prey are unusually scarce. By providing quantitative predictions of bird survival and numbers of a range of alternative shellfishery management regimes, the model can guide management policy in these and other estuaries.},

We examine individual-based ecology (IBE), a research paradigm that promises better a predictive ability by using individual-based models (IBMs) to represent ecological dynamics as arising from how individuals interact with their environment and with each other. A key advantage of IBMs is that the basis for predictions-fitness maximization by individual organisms-is more general and reliable than the empirical relationships that other models depend on. Case studies illustrate the usefulness and predictive success of long-term IBE programs. The pioneering programs had three phases: conceptualization, implementation, and diversification. Continued validation of models runs throughout these phases. The breakthroughs that make IBE more productive include standards for describing and validating IBMs, improved and standardized theory for individual traits and behavior, software tools, and generalized instead of system-specific IBMs. We provide guidelines for pursuing IBE and a vision for future IBE research.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Many farmland bird species have undergone significant declines. It is important to predict the effect of agricultural change on these birds and their response to conservation measures. This requirement could be met by mechanistic models that predict population size from the optimal foraging behaviour and fates of individuals within populations. A key component of these models is the functional response, the relationship between food and competitor density and feeding rate. 2. This paper describes a method for measuring functional responses of farmland birds, and applies this method to a declining farmland bird, the corn bunting Miliaria calandra L. We derive five alternative models to predict the functional responses of farmland birds and parameterize these for corn bunting. We also assess the minimum sample sizes required to predict accurately the functional response. 3. We show that the functional response of corn bunting can be predicted accurately from a few behavioural parameters (searching rate, handling time, vigilance time) that are straightforward to measure in the field. These parameters can be measured more quickly than the alternative of measuring the functional response directly. 4. While corn bunting violated some of the assumptions of Holling{'}s disk equation (model 1 in our study), it still provided the most accurate fit to the observed feeding rates while remaining the most statistically simple model tested. Our other models may be more applicable to other species, or corn bunting feeding in other locations. 5. Although further tests are required, our study shows how functional responses can be predicted, simplifying the development of mechanistic models of farmland bird populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The conservation importance of estuaries is often measured by bird numbers, but monitoring numbers is not necessarily a reliable way of assessing changes in site quality. We used an individual-based model, comprised of fitness-maximising individuals, to assess the quality of the Humber estuary, UK, for 9 shorebirds; dunlin Calidris alpina, common ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula, red knot Calidris canutus, common redshank Tringa totanus, grey plover Pluvialis squatarola, blacktailed godwit Limosa limosa, bar-tailed godwit L. lapponica, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata. We measured site quality as predicted overwinter survival. The model accurately predicted the observed shorebird distribution (if non-starving birds were assumed to feed on any prey or patch on which intake rate equalled or exceeded their requirements), and the diets of most species. Predicted survival rates were highest in dunlin and common ringed plovers, the smallest species, and in Eurasian oystercatchers, which consumed larger prey than the other species. Shorebird survival was most strongly influenced by the biomass densities of annelid worms, and the bivalve molluscs Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica. A 2 to 8 % reduction in intertidal area (the magnitude expected through sea level rise and industrial developments) decreased predicted survival rates of all species except the dunlin, common ringed plover, red knot and Eurasian oystercatcher. This paper shows how an individual-based model can assess present-day site quality and predict how site quality may change in the future. The model was developed using existing data from intertidal invertebrate and bird monitoring schemes plus new intertidal invertebrate data collected over 2 winters. We believe that individual-based models are useful tools for assessing estuarine site quality.},

We provide evidence that interference between overwintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus feeding on mussels Mytilus edulis is absent or has only a negligible effect on intake rate at low competitor densities, and only reduces intake rate above a threshold bird density. The threshold for interference did not differ significantly between individual birds and showed no association with their local dominance. The threshold value was c. 50 birds ha{'}- for birds that opened prey by hammering and 150 birds ha-{'} for those that stabbed into mussels. 2. The interference-free intake rate at densities below the threshold for interference differed significantly between individual birds but was not associated with local dominance; nor did it vary either during the tidal exposure period or between autumn and winter. 3. At competitor densities above the threshold for interference, birds of lower local dominance were more susceptible to interference than those of higher dominance, the magnitude of the difference being smaller in hammering birds than in stabbers. For birds of a given local dominance, interference was most intense towards the end of winter and, in hammerers, at the beginning of the exposure period. 4. We conclude that theoretical models in which interference operates as soon as competitor density starts to increase provide a poor description of this system. Rather, our data support those models in which interference begins only after density has reached a particular, and constant, level},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the long-term effects of a CO2 exhalation, created more than 70 years ago, on a natural C-4 dominated sub-tropical grassland in terms of ecosystem structure and functioning. We tested whether long-term CO2 enrichment changes the competitive balance between plants with C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways and how CO2 enrichment has affected species composition, plant growth responses, leaf properties and soil nutrient, carbon and water dynamics. Long-term effects of elevated CO2 on plant community composition and system processes in this sub-tropical grassland indicate very subtle changes in ecosystem functioning and no changes in species composition and dominance which could be ascribed to elevated CO2 alone. Species compositional data and soil delta(13)C isotopic evidence suggest no detectable effect of CO2 enrichment on C-3:C-4 plant mixtures and individual species dominance. Contrary to many general predictions C-3 grasses did not become more abundant and C-3 shrubs and trees did not invade the site. No season length stimulation of plant growth was found even after 5 years of exposure to CO2 concentrations averaging 610 mu mol mol(-1). Leaf properties such as total N decreased in the C-3 but not C-4 grass under elevated CO2 while total non-structural carbohydrate accumulation was not affected. Elevated CO2 possibly lead to increased end-of-season soil water contents and this result agrees with earlier studies despite the topographic water gradient being a confounding problem at our research site. Long-term CO2 enrichment also had little effect on soil carbon storage with no detectable changes in soil organic matter found. There were indications that potential soil respiration and N mineralization rates could be higher in soils close to the CO2 source. The conservative response of this grassland suggests that many of the reported effects of elevated CO2 on similar ecosystems could be short duration experimental artefacts that disappear under long-term elevated CO2 conditions. },

Because, sampling species{'} distributions is costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90% of maximum within ten sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic distribution was the only significant ecological factor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim{\enspace} While niche models are typically used to assess the vulnerability of species to climate change, they have been criticized for their limited assessment of threats other than climate change. We attempt to evaluate this limitation by combining niche models with life-history models to investigate the relative influence of climate change and a range of fire regimes on the viability of a long-lived plant population. Specifically, we investigate whether range shift due to climate change is a greater threat to an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub than altered fire frequency and how these two threatening processes might interact. Location{\enspace} Australian sclerophyll woodland and heathland. Methods{\enspace} The study species is Leucopogon setiger, an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub. A spatially explicit stochastic matrix model was constructed for this species and linked with a dynamic niche model and fire risk functions representing a suite of average fire return intervals. We compared scenarios with a variety of hypothetical patches, a patch framework based upon current habitat suitability and one with dynamic habitat suitability based on climate change scenarios A1FI and A2. Results{\enspace} Leucopogon setiger was found to be sensitive to fire frequency, with shorter intervals reducing expected minimum abundances (EMAs). Spatial decoupling of fires across the landscape reduced the vulnerability of the species to shortened fire frequencies. Shifting habitat, while reducing EMAs, was less of a threat to the species than frequent fire. Main conclusions{\enspace} Altered fire regime, in particular more frequent fires relative to the historical regime, was predicted to be a strong threat to this species, which may reflect a vulnerability of obligate seeders in general. Range shifts induced by climate change were a secondary threat when habitat reductions were predicted. Incorporating life-history traits into habitat suitability models by linking species distribution models with population models allowed for the population-level evaluation of multiple stressors that affect population dynamics and habitat, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impacts of global change than would be gained by niche models alone. Further investigations of this type could elucidate how particular bioecological factors can affect certain types of species under global change},

Significant variables identified by these procedures were then used to develop ecological niche models that permitted detailed-and improved-predictions of the species{'} overall distribution. These methods identified seven climatic factors (four of temperature factors and three atmospheric moisture factors) from among 40 environmental variables related to the range of this species. In addition, the gradient-analysis tool identified elevation as being particularly important. The distributional hypothesis predicted using ecological niche modeling of these factors included all of the record sites from which An. farauti s.s. was collected in northern Australia and successfully reconstructed its narrow limitation to coastal areas. Omission of elevation from analyses resulted in unrealistic predictions of potential distributional areas \textgreater 100 km inland, where the species has not been found.},

  Abstract                 = {A major conservation concern is whether population size and other ecological variables change linearly with habitat loss, or whether they suddenly decline more rapidly below a {``}critical threshold{''} level of habitat. The most commonly discussed explanation for critical threshold responses to habitat loss focus on habitat configuration. As habitat loss progresses, the remaining habitat is increasingly fragmented or the fragments are increasingly isolated, which may compound the effects of habitat loss. In this review we also explore other possible explanations for apparently nonlinear relationships between habitat loss and ecological responses, including Allee effects and time lags, and point out that some ecological variables will inherently respond nonlinearly to habitat loss even in the absence of compounding factors. In the literature, both linear and nonlinear ecological responses to habitat loss are evident among simulation and empirical studies, although the presence and value of critical thresholds is influenced by characteristics of the species (e. g. dispersal, reproduction, area/edge sensitivity) and landscape (e. g. fragmentation, matrix quality, rate of change). With enough empirical support, such trends could be useful for making important predictions about species{'} responses to habitat loss, to guide future research on the underlying causes of critical thresholds, and to make better informed management decisions. Some have seen critical thresholds as a means of identifying conservation targets for habitat retention. We argue that in many cases this may be misguided, and that the meaning (and utility) of a critical threshold must be interpreted carefully and in relation to the response variable and management goal. Despite recent interest in critical threshold responses to habitat loss, most studies have not used any formal statistical methods to identify their presence or value. Methods that have been used include model comparisons using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or t-tests, and significance testing for changes in slope or for polynomial effects. The judicious use of statistics to help determine the shape of ecological relationships would permit greater objectivity and more comparability among studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans affect biodiversity at the genetic, species, community, and ecosystem levels. This impact on genetic diversity is critical, because genetic diversity is the raw material of evolutionary change, including adaptation and speciation. Two forces affecting genetic variation are genetic drift (which decreases genetic variation within but increases genetic differentiation among local populations) and gene flow (which increases variation within but decreases differentiation among local populations). Humans activities often augment drift and diminish gene flow for many species, which reduces genetic variation in local populations and prevents the spread of adaptive complexes outside their population of origin, thereby disrupting adaptive processes both locally and globally within a species. These impacts are illustrated with collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) in the Missouri Ozarks. Forest fire suppression has reduced habitat and disrupted gene flow in this lizard, thereby altering the balance toward drift and away from gene flow. This balance can be restored by managed landscape burns. Some have argued that, although human-induced fragmentation disrupts adaptation, it will also ultimately produce new species through founder effects. However, population genetic theory and experiments predict that most fragmentation events caused by human activities will facilitate not speciation, but local extinction. Founder events have played an important role in the macroevolution of certain groups, but only when ecological opportunities are expanding rather than contracting. The general impact of human activities on genetic diversity disrupts or diminishes the capacity for adaptation, speciation, and macroevolutionary change. This impact will ultimately diminish biodiversity at all levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Among the most popular strategies for maintaining populations of both plants and animals in fragmented landscapes is to connect isolated patches with thin strips of habitat, called corridors. Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant-animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant-animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.},

It is found that a simple rule relates the low-energy edge of the {``}N band{''} previously attributed to the one-center (Landau-type) hole polaron, the photon energy of the (two-photon) excitation pulse, and the band gap. The rule explains the quantitative photon-energy dependence of the N-band position and its presence or absence in all of the data compiled from the present work and other published works, within the framework of two-photon cross-correlated absorption of the excitation and probe pulses as well as pulse dispersion considered separately in the optics and in the sample. It is concluded that the one-center self-trapped hole in alkali halides has not yet been identified by absorption spectroscopy in the visible-uv spectral range. The self-trapped hole and/or associated self-trapped exciton is observed in the two-center (V-k) cofiguration. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using projections of species{'} distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth{'}s terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be {'}committed to extinction{'}. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18%) than mid-range ( approximately 24%) and maximum-change ( approximately 35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

Here, using four niche-based models, two methods to derive probability values from models into presence{--}absence data and five climate change scenarios, I project the future potential habitats of 1350 European plant species for 2050. All 40 different projections of species turnover across Europe suggested high potential species turnover (up to 70%) in response to climate change. However variability in the potential distributional changes of species across climate scenarios was obscured by a strong variability in projections arising from alternative, yet equally justifiable, niche-based models. Therefore, projections of future species distributions and derived community descriptors cannot be reliably discussed unless model uncertainty is quantified explicitly. I propose and test an alternative way to account for modelling variability when deriving estimates of species turnover (with and without dispersal) according to a range of climate change scenarios representing various socio-economic futures.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Bioclimatic envelope models are often used to make projections of species{'} potential responses to climate change. It can be hypothesized that species with different kinds of distributions in environmental niche and geographical space may respond differently to changes in climate. Here, we compare projections of shifts in species ranges with simple descriptors of species niche (position and breadth) and geographical (range size) distributions. Location Europe. Methods The future distribution for 1200 European plant species were predicted by niche-based models using seven climate variables known to have an important role in limiting plant species distributions. Ecological niche properties were estimated using a multivariate analysis. Species range changes were then related to species niche properties using generalized linear models. Results Generally, percentage of remaining suitable habitat in the future increased linearly with niche position and breadth. Increases in potential suitable habitat were associated with greater range size, and had a hump-shaped relationship with niche position on temperature gradient. By relating species chorotypes to percentage of remaining or gained habitat, we highlighted biogeographical patterns of species sensitivity to climate change. These were clearly related to the degree of exposure according to regional patterns of projected climate change. Main conclusion This study highlights general patterns about the relationships between sensitivity of species to climate change and their ecological properties. There is a strong convergence between simple inferences based on ecological characteristics of species and projections by bioclimatic {'}envelope{'} models, confirming macroecological assumptions about species sensitivity based on niche properties. These patterns appear to be most strongly driven by the exposure of species to climate change, with additional effects of species niche characteristics. We conclude that simple species niche properties are powerful indicators of species{'} sensitivity to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts in many parts of the world. Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42% and 45-63% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86% and 17-86%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (approximate to 60% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid anthropogenic climate change is already affecting species distributions and ecosystem functioning worldwide. We applied niche-based models to analyse the impact of climate change on tree species and functional diversity in Europe. Present-day climate was used to predict the distributions of 122 tree species from different functional types (FT). We then explored projections of future distributions under one climate scenario for 2080, considering two alternative dispersal assumptions: no dispersal and unlimited dispersal. The species-rich broadleaved deciduous group appeared to play a key role in the future of different European regions. Temperate areas were projected to lose both species richness and functional diversity due to the loss of broadleaved deciduous trees. These were projected to migrate to boreal forests, thereby increasing their species richness and functional diversity. Atlantic areas provided an intermediate case, with a predicted reduction in the numbers of species and occasional predicted gains in functional diversity. This resulted from a loss in species within the broadleaved deciduous FT, but overall maintenance of the group. Our results illustrate the fact that both species-specific predictions and functional patterns should be examined separately in order to assess the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and gain insights into future ecosystem functioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Using new tools (boosted regression trees) in predictive biogeography, with extensive spatial 23 distribution data for \textgreater 19 000 species, we developed predictive models for South African plant species richness patterns. Further, biome level analysis explored possible functional determinants of country-wide regional species richness. Finally, to test model reliability independently, we predicted potential alien invasive plant species richness with an independent dataset. Amongst the different hypotheses generally invoked to explain species 30 diversity (energy, favorableness, topographic heterogeneity, irregularity and seasonality), results revealed topographic heterogeneity as the most powerful single explanatory variable for indigenous South African plant species richness. Some biome-specific responses were observed, i.e. two of the five analyzed biomes (Fynbos and Grassland) had richness best explained by the "species-favorableness" hypothesis, but even in this case, topographic heterogeneity was also a primary predictor. This analysis, the largest conducted on an almost exhaustive species sample in a species-rich region, demonstrates the preeminence of topographic heterogeneity in shaping the spatial pattern of regional plant species richness. Model reliability was confirmed by the considerable predictive power for alien invasive species richness. It thus appears that topographic heterogeneity controls species richness in two main ways: firstly, by providing an abundance of ecological niches in contemporary space (revealed by alien invasive species richness relationships) and secondly, by facilitating the persistence of ecological niches through time. The extraordinary richness of the South African Fynbos biome, a world-renowned hotspot of biodiversity with the steepest environmental gradients in South Africa, may thus have arisen through both mechanisms. Comparisons with similar regions of the world outside South Africa are needed to confirm the generality of topographic heterogeneity and favorableness as predictors of plant richness.},

  Abstract                 = {A new computation framework (BIOMOD: BIOdiversity MODelling) is presented, which aims to maximize the predictive accuracy of current species distributions and the reliability of future potential distributions using different types of statistical modelling methods. BIOMOD capitalizes on the different techniques used in static modelling to provide spatial predictions. It computes, for each species and in the same package, the four most widely used modelling techniques in species predictions, namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). BIOMOD was applied to 61 species of trees in Europe using climatic quantities as explanatory variables of current distributions. On average, all the different modelling methods yielded very good agreement between observed and predicted distributions. However, the relative performance of different techniques was idiosyncratic across species, suggesting that the most accurate model varies between species. The results of this evaluation also highlight that slight differences between current predictions from different modelling techniques are exacerbated in future projections. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the reliability of alternative projections without validation techniques or expert opinion. It is concluded that rather than using a single modelling technique to predict the distribution of several species, it would be more reliable to use a framework assessing different models for each species and selecting the most accurate one using both evaluation methods and expert knowledge.},

The predictive accuracy of the models was assessed using the ROC curve approach. Potential distribution maps of tree species were generated for the whole Catalonia region. Results Models were ranked from low to high accuracy for the 24 species. Differences in accuracy among species were related to the chorological status of species. Zonal species, or species at the core of their range (Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species), were generally well predicted, while extrazonal species, or species at the edge of their range, were predicted only moderately well. Mediterranean species distributions showed good correlations with extreme temperatures and annual precipitation. Main conclusions The above trends confirmed the difficulty of identifying the realized niche of species at the edges of their ranges. In contrast, Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species, which were at the core of their range, were well-predicted, confirming the importance of extremes of temperature and annual precipitation as effective surrogates for variables having more direct physiological roles in limiting the ability of plants to survive and grow. Maps of potential tree distributions allowed us to define suitable habitats and to highlight areas where species have been planted outside their natural distribution.},

We developed ecological niche models and predicted geographic distributions for 89 species of birds ecologically restricted to Mexican rain forests, and used heuristic complementarity algorithms to identify priority areas for conservation. Our results focused on a single contiguous region of northern Chiapas as a key area - all, species except three were predicted to co-occur in this area, which is made up of thremne highly complementary sub-areas. The relationship between this area and existing protected areas was explored, and concrete recommendations made for modification of existing protected areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

  Abstract                 = {$\bullet$ Premise of the study: Oaks are dominant trees and key species in many temperate and subtropical forests in the world. In this study, we analyzed patterns of distribution of red oaks (Quercus, section Lobatae) occurring in Mexico and Central America to determine areas of species richness and endemism to propose areas of conservation. $\bullet$ Methods: Patterns of richness and endemism of 75 red oak species were analyzed using three different units. Two complementarity algorithms based on species richness and three algorithms based on species rarity were used to identify important areas for conservation. A simulated annealing analysis was performed to evaluate and formulate effective new reserves for red oaks that are useful for conserving the ecosystems associated with them after the systematic conservation planning approach. $\bullet$ Key results: Two main centers of species richness were detected. The northern Sierra Madre Oriental and Serran{\'{i}}as Meridionales of Jalisco had the highest values of endemism. Fourteen areas were considered as priorities for conservation of red oak species based on the 26 priority political entities, 11 floristic units and the priority grid-cells obtained in the complementarity analysis. In the present network of Natural Protected Areas in Mexico and Central America, only 41.3% (31 species) of the red oak species are protected. The simulated annealing analysis indicated that to protect all 75 species of red oaks, 12 current natural protected areas need to be expanded by 120000 ha of additional land, and 26 new natural protected areas with 512500 ha need to be created. $\bullet$ Conclusions: Red oaks are a useful model to identify areas for conservation based on species richness and endemism as a result of their wide geographic distribution and a high number of species. We evaluated and reformulated new reserves for red oaks that are also useful for the conservation of ecosystems associated with them.},

We describe an integrated framework for conducting wildlife censuses to obtain data to build predictive models of species distribution that when integrated in a GIS will produce a distribution map. Field data can be obtained with greater accuracy and at lower costs using a combination of Global Positioning System, Personal Digital Assistant, and specific wildlife recording software. Sampling design benefits from previous knowledge of environmental variability that can be obtained from free remote sensing data. Environmental predictors derived from this remote sensing information alone, combined with automatic procedures for predictor selection and model fitting, can render cost-effective predictive distribution models for wildlife.

Summary Interference is an important component of food competition but is often difficult to detect and measure in natural animal populations. Although interference has been shown to occur between oystercatchers Haemnatopus ostralegus L. feeding on mussels Mytilus edulis L., four previous studies have not detected interference between oyster-catchers feeding on cockles Ceracstodernma edule L. In contrast, this study detected interference between cockle-feeding oystercatchers in the Baie de Somme, France. Prey stealing (kleptoparasitism), one of the main causes of interference between mussel-feeders, also occurred between oystercatchers in the Baie de Somme. The kleptoparasitism rate was related to the natural variation in the food supply, tending to be higher when cockles were rare. Feeding rate was negatively related to competitor density, so providing evidence for interference, but, as in mussel-feeders, only above a threshold density of about 50-1 00 birds ha-. The strength of interference at a fixed competitor density was related to the cockle food supply, usually being greater when cockles were rare. Previous studies probably failed to detect interference between cockle-feeders because competitor densities were too low, or cockles were too abun-dant, or because they were not conducted during late winter when interference is most intense. The study shows that natural variation in the food supply can influence the strength of interference within an animal population and provides support for those behaviour-based interference models which predict that the strength of interference will be greatest when competitor densities are high and prey scarce.},

  Abstract                 = {Information to guide decision making is especially urgent in human dominated landscapes in the tropics, where urban and agricultural frontiers are still expanding in an unplanned manner. Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models. The few consistent responses to the variation in spatial scales indicate that despite their small size, small mammals perceive landscape features at large spatial scales. Matrix quality index corresponding to species occurrence presented a better or similar performance compared to that of species abundance. Results indicate the importance of the matrix for the dynamics of fragmented landscapes and suggest that relatively simple indices can improve our understanding of species distribution, and could be applied in modeling, monitoring and managing complex tropical landscapes.},

It is noted that all test statistics for the 2 x 2 table have discrete distributions and it is suggested that it is irrational to prescribe an unattainable fixed significance level. The use of mid-P is suggested, if a formula is required for prescribing a variable tail probability. The problems of two-tail tests are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {1. In order to predict the spatial distribution of {`}ideal{'} and {`}free{'} predators, one needs to know how food intake rate of an individual predator is related to characteristics of the population of the prey as well as the predators themselves. 2. Surprisingly, a systematic theoretical investigation of models for the basic case, where both prey and predators are best characterized by their {`}standing stock{'} density, is lacking. In these models intake rate is supposed to decrease with increasing predator density as a result of interference among predators, instead of immediate consumption of the prey. 3. This paper compares the various ways applied so far of incorporating interference in Holling{'}s functional response model. It is shown that the different models of interference result in qualitatively different predictions for {`}ideal{'} and {`}free{'} predators on: (i) the form of the aggregative response; (ii) the trajectory of the aggregative response as prey is depleted; and (iii) the change in the aggregative response following an influx of predators. This sheds doubt on the general relevance of any one of these models, particularly if the mathematical formulation of interference is phenomenological and merely based on convention, instead of being derived from the underlying mechanism of interactions between predators. 4. Our results underline the need for detailed knowledge about the components of the predation process in order to arrive at predictions for a specific case.},

It includes discussions of various statistical methods, such as principal component analysis, regression analysis, classification methods, and clustering. Written by a chemometrician and a statistician, the book reflects both the practical approach of chemometrics and the more formally oriented one of statistics. To enable a better understanding of the statistical methods, the authors apply them to real data examples from chemistry. They also examine results of the different methods, comparing traditional approaches with their robust counterparts. In addition, the authors use the freely available R package to implement methods, encouraging readers to go through the examples and adapt the procedures to their own problems. Focusing on the practicality of the methods and the validity of the results, this book offers concise mathematical descriptions of many multivariate methods and employs graphical schemes to visualize key concepts. It effectively imparts a basic understanding of how to apply statistical methods to multivariate scientific data.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistics and hypothesis testing are routinely used in areas (such as linguistics) that are traditionally not mathematically intensive. In such fields, when faced with experimental data, many students and researchers tend to rely on commercial packages to carry out statistical data analysis, often without understanding the logic of the statistical tests they rely on. As a consequence, results are often misinterpreted, and users have difficulty in flexibly applying techniques relevant to their own research {--}- they use whatever they happen to have learned. A simple solution is to teach the fundamental ideas of statistical hypothesis testing without using too much mathematics. This book provides a non-mathematical, simulation-based introduction to basic statistical concepts and encourages readers to try out the simulations themselves using the source code and data provided (the freely available programming language R is used throughout). Since the code presented in the text almost always requires the use of previously introduced programming constructs, diligent students also acquire basic programming abilities in R. The book is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in any discipline, although the focus is on linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. It is designed for self-instruction, but it can also be used as a textbook for a first course on statistics. Earlier versions of the book have been used in undergraduate and graduate courses in Europe and the US.},

  Abstract                 = {Background and Aims Leaf thickness plays an important role in leaf and plant functioning, and relates to a species{'} strategy of resource acquisition and use. As such, it has been widely used for screening purposes in crop science and community ecology. However, since its measurement is not straightforward, a number of estimates have been proposed. Here, the validity of the (SLA x LDMC)(-1) product is tested to estimate leaf thickness, where SLA is the specific leaf area (leaf area/dry mass) and LDMC is the leaf dry matter content (leaf dry mass/fresh mass). SLA and LDMC are two leaf traits that are both more easily measurable and often reported in the literature. Methods The relationship between leaf thickness (LT) and (SLA x LDMC)(-1) was tested in two analyses of covariance using 11 datasets (three original and eight published) for a total number of 1039 data points, corresponding to a wide range of growth forms growing in contrasted environments in four continents. Key Results and Conclusions The overall slope and intercept of the relationship were not significantly different from one and zero, respectively, and the residual standard error was 0.11. Only two of the eight datasets displayed a significant difference in the intercepts, and the only significant difference among the most represented growth forms was for trees. LT can therefore be estimated by (SLA x LDMC)(-1), allowing leaf thickness to be derived from easily and widely measured leaf traits. },

  Abstract                 = {Key message: Competition-density relationships and self-thinning are major principles in forest growth. They are combined, describing self-thinning as a marginal case of the competition-density relationship. Robust estimation techniques allow parameterizing of both from national forest inventory data even for minor species. Context: The competition-density principle, which can mathematically be described by the competition-density rule, is an important principle in plant ecology. The border line relationship is the self-thinning rule. Despite the importance of both rules for forest management, they have been fit for few species. Aims: The aim of this study is to compare competition-density rule and self-thinning rule in particular with respect to potential density for 15 species from the Austrian National Forest Inventory (ANFI). Methods: The self-thinning line was estimated using quantile regression. The competition-density rule was fit as four- and as three-parameter model, where the fourth parameter was substituted (a) with a specific slope from the self-thinning line estimated from the ANFI and (b) Reineke{'}s slope ($-$1.605). Results: Potential density was highest for Austrian pine and Norway spruce, followed by silver fir and Scots pine; it was considerably lower for European larch, stone pine and broadleaf species. Species-specific slopes of the self-thinning line ranged between $-$1.5 and $-$2.0 and were significantly different from Reineke{'}s slope for Norway spruce, European larch and European beech. Conclusions: Using robust estimation techniques, both competition-density rule and self-thinning line can also be fit for minor species, providing an important guide for practical forest management.},

Here, we compare and contrast ENM-based reconstructions of LGM refugial locations with those resulting from the more traditional molecular genetic and phylogeographic predictions. We examined 20 North American terrestrial vertebrate species from different regions and with different range sizes for which refugia have been identified based on phylogeographic analyses, using ENM tools to make parallel predictions. We then assessed the correspondence between the two approaches based on spatial overlap and areal extent of the predicted refugia. In 14 of the 20 species, the predictions from ENM and predictions based on phylogeographic studies were significantly spatially correlated, suggesting that the two approaches to development of refugial maps are converging on a similar result. Our results confirm that ENM scenario exploration can provide a useful complement to molecular studies, offering a less subjective, spatially explicit hypothesis of past geographic patterns of distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental tests of management policy options are becoming popular to resolve uncertainties arising from ecological processes and interactions that cannot be investigated except at held management scales. Such experiments are generally quite costly, time consuming, and sometimes risky We need objective measures of these costs and risks to justify sensible experiments and to compare design alternatives that differ widely in cost and effectiveness. One possible measure of design performance is the expected net present value from the system, averaged over alternative hypotheses about response to experimental treatment. This present value can be estimated by dividing the future stream of expected net benefits into 2 components: short run values obtained during the experiment, and long run values obtained afterward. Experiments that are costly in the short run can be highly worthwhile for the long term if they substantially reduce the odds of using incorrect policies or of overlooking opportunities for increasing value through innovative policy choices, and if the results can be applied to many locations. Optimum experiments in terms of the expected value performance measure are not likely to have as much statistical power as scientists usually demand for traditional hypothesis testing, except in situations where the costs of incorrectly adopting a new management option are high relative to benefits obtained under that option.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration (700 mumol mol(-1)) on defoliated (three clippings at 3-week intervals) and undefoliated plants were determined for the C-4 grass Themeda triandra, Forsk. The elevated CO2 concentration significantly increased leaf regrowth following defoliation, and total leaf production was greatest in this treatment. Shoot biomass of undefoliated plants was also increased under the elevated CO2 concentration treatment. The primary effect of the elevated CO2 concentration in both defoliated and undefoliated plants was an increase in individual leaf length and mass of dry matter, linked to a higher leaf water content and increased photosynthetic rates at the canopy level. Photosynthetic down-regulation at the leaf level occurred, but this was compensated for by increased assimilation rates and greater canopy leaf area at the elevated CO2 concentration. Increases in leaf and sheath growth of defoliated plants in the elevated CO2 concentration treatment were lost following a final 3-week reversion to ambient CO2 concentration, but occurred in plants exposed to the elevated CO2 concentration for the final 3-week period only. In conclusion, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increases shoot growth via increased leaf extension, which is directly dependent on stimulation of concurrent photosynthesis. CO2 responsiveness is sustained following moderate defoliation but is reduced when plants experience reduced vigour as a result of maturation or high frequency of defoliation. },

  Abstract                 = {C4 plants contribute approximate to 20% of global gross primary productivity, and uncertainties regarding their responses to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations may limit predictions of future global change impacts on C4-dominated ecosystems. These uncertainties have not yet been considered rigorously due to expectations of C4 low responsiveness based on photosynthetic theory and early experiments. We carried out a literature review (1980-97) and meta-analysis in order to identify emerging patterns of C4 grass responses to elevated CO2, as compared with those of C3 grasses. The focus was on nondomesticated Poaceae alone, to the exclusion of C4 dicotyledonous and C4 crop species. This provides a clear test, controlled for genotypic variability at family level, of differences between the CO2-responsiveness of these functional types. Eleven responses were considered, ranging from physiological behaviour at the leaf level to carbon allocation patterns at the whole plant level. Results were also assessed in the context of environmental stress conditions (light, temperature, water and nutrient stress), and experimental growing conditions (pot size, experimental duration and fumigation method). Both C4 and C3 species increased total biomass significantly in elevated CO2, by 33% and 44%, respectively. Differing tendencies between types in shoot structural response were revealed: C3 species showed a greater increase in tillering, whereas C4 species showed a greater increase in leaf area in elevated CO2. At the leaf level, significant stomatal closure and increased leaf water use efficiency were confirmed in both types, and higher carbon assimilation rates were found in both C3 and C4 species (33% and 25%, respectively). Environmental stress did not alter the C4 CO2-response, except for the loss of a significant positive CO2-response for above-ground biomass and leaf area under water stress. In C3 species, stimulation of carbon assimilation rate was reduced by stress (overall), and nutrient stress tended to reduce the mean biomass response to elevated CO2. Leaf carbohydrate status increased and leaf nitrogen concentration decreased significantly in elevated CO2 only in C3 species. We conclude that the relative responses of the C4 and C3 photosynthetic types to elevated CO2 concur only to some extent with expectations based on photosynthetic theory. The significant positive responses of C4 grass species at both the leaf and the whole plant level demand a re-evaluation of the assumption of low responsiveness in C4 plants at both levels, and not only with regard to water relations. The combined shoot structural and water use efficiency responses of these functional types will have consequential implications for the water balance of important catchments and range lands throughout the world, especially in semiarid subtropical and temperate regions. It may be premature to predict that C4 grass species will lose their competitive advantage over C3 grass species in elevated CO2. },

Net CO2 assimilation rate and leaf water use efficiency increased in elevated CO2, but increased UV-B did not affect gas exchange.

Changes in reproductive phenology and prolonged development in elevated CO2 during the stressful late season could indirectly be detrimental to reproductive success of D. pluvialis, but stimulation of reproduction by enhanced UV-B may to some extent mitigate this.

  Abstract                 = {The interactive effects of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation on Acacia karroo Hayne, a C-3 tree, and Themeda triandra Forsk., a C-4 grass, were investigated. We tested the hypothesis that A. karroo would show greater CO2-induced growth stimulation than T. triandra, which would partially explain current encroachment of A. karroo into C-4 grasslands, but that increased UV-B could mitigate this advantage. Seedlings were grown in open-top chambers in a greenhouse in ambient (360 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (650 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2, combined with ambient (1.56 to 8.66 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) or increased (2.22 to 11.93 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) biologically effective (weighted) UV-B irradiances. After 30 weeks, elevated CO2 had no effect on biomass of A. karroo, despite increased net CO2 assimilation rates. Interaction between UV-B and CO2 on stomatal conductance was found, with conductances decreasing only where elevated CO2 and UV-B were supplied separately. Increases in water use efficiencies, foliar starch concentrations, root nodule numbers and total nodule mass were measured in elevated CO2. Elevated UV-B caused only an increase in foliar carbon concentrations. In T. triandra, net CO2 assimilation rates were unaffected in elevated CO2, but stomatal conductances and foliar nitrogen concentrations decreased, and water use efficiencies increased. Biomass of all vegetative fractions, particularly leaf sheaths, was increased in elevated CO2, and was accompanied by increased leaf blade lengths and individual leaf and leaf sheath masses. However, tiller numbers were reduced in elevated CO2. Significantly moderating effects of elevated UV-B were apparent only in individual masses of leaf blades and sheaths, and in total sheath and shoot biomass. The direct CO2-induced growth responses of the species therefore do not support the hypothesis of CO2-driven woody encroachment of C-4 grasslands. Rather, differential changes in resource use efficiency between grass and woody species, or morphological responses of grass species, could alter the competitive balance. Increased UV-B radiation is unlikely to substantially alter the CO2 response of these species. },

Gas exchange and above-ground growth in ambient and elevated CO2 (360 and 660 mu mol mol(-1), respectively) were determined in three NADP-ME species, two NAD-ME species, two PCK species and one C-3 species, all excavated from the same field site. Plants were grown in open-top chambers in a greenhouse for 178 d. Net CO2 assimilation rates were only significantly increased in one NAD-ME species, but stomatal conductances decreased (in six out of eight species, by a mean of 46%) and instantaneous leaf water-use efficiency increased (in all species, by a mean of 89%) in elevated CO2. These responses did not differ between photosynthetic pathways. Parameters derived from photosynthetic CO2 and light response curves were also not differentially influenced by CO2 treatment between pathways. Gas exchange responses were generally poorly related to CO2 responsiveness. Significant increases in leaf growth and canopy leaf area in elevated CO2 were found in two NADP-ME species, whereas increases in non-leaf above-ground growth were measured in three species representing all three C-4 subtypes. Growth responses in elevated CO2 were apparently not simply correlated with biochemical subtype characteristics, although the most significant responses (particularly at the leaf level) were found for the NADP-ME pathway. This result was more likely attributable to the significant positive correlation found between CO2 responsiveness of leaf growth and relative leaf regrowth potential of individual species, the latter being higher in the two responsive NADP-ME species. Therefore, categorisation of PFTs according to relative growth potential may be more appropriate for predictions of CO2 responsiveness in C-4 grasses. },

  Abstract                 = {Animals are frequently faced with trade-offs created by the fact that both resource acquisition and risk of mortality increase with activity, for example, with foraging speed or time spent foraging. We develop models predicting adaptive responses for both foraging speed and proportion of time active when individual growth rate and mortality fisk are functions of these variables. Using the criterion that animals should minimize the ratio of mortality to growth rates, we show that, when both growth and mortality rates are linear with activity levels, the latter should be either maximal or minimal depending on resource level. If growth rate is a decelerating function of activity, then speed or time active should decrease with increases in resources, handling time, or the effect of activity on mortality rate. By contrast, if mortality rate unrelated to activity increases, then activity rate also should increase. We also develop predictions for cases in which time horizon is critical using a dynamic programming framework. The general patterns of predicted activity responses are similar to the time-invariant analytical solutions, but foraging speed is reduced relative to the analytical solutions when time remaining is long or when accumulated reserves are high. This effect is ameliorated when accumulated reserves (size) increase resource capture efficiency or reduce mortality fisk. If resources decline with time (e.g., because of competition) optimal foraging speeds are also higher than predicted by the analytical solutions. We discuss the relation of our predictions to previous models and the available empirical evidence. The majority of available data appear to be consistent with our models, and in some cases quantitative comparisons are quite close. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for ontogenetic changes in behavior and for population- and community-level phenomena, particularly the role of activity responses in competitive interactions and indirect effects and patterns of coexistence among competitors.},

In this paper we use a behaviour-based model to predict the impact of human disturbance on oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) on their intertidal feeding grounds in the Exe estuary in winter. The model predicted that, for the same overall area disturbed, numerous small disturbances would be more damaging than fewer, larger disturbances. When the time and energy costs arising from disturbance were included, disturbance could be more damaging than permanent habitat loss. Preventing disturbance during late winter, when feeding conditions were harder, practically eliminated its predicted population consequences. Although disturbance can cause increased mortality, it was not predicted to do so at the levels currently occurring in the Exe estuary. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year{'}s data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a technique for estimating size-age relations and size-dependent mortality patterns of long-lived plants. The technique requires two sets of size data of individual (non-marked) plants that should be collected with a time-lag of several years in the same area of a study site. The basic idea of our technique is to assume general (three parameter) families of size-dependent functions which describe growth and mortality that occurred between the two data gathering events. We apply these growth and mortality functions to the size data of the early data set and construct predicted size-class distributions to compare it, in a systematic way, to the size-class distribution of the later data set. In a next step we calculate the size-age relations from the resulting growth functions, which yield the smallest difference between observed and predicted size-class distribution. Applying this technique to size data of five dominant shrub species at the Tierberg study site in the semiarid Karoo, South Africa produced new insight into the biology of these species which otherwise cannot be obtained without frequent measurements of marked plants. We could relate characteristics of growth behavior and mortality, for certain subgroups of the five species, to the life-history attributes evergreen vs. deciduous, succulent vs. woody, and early reproductive vs. late reproductive. The results of our pilot-study suggest a broad applicability of our technique to other shrublands of the world. This requires at least one older record of (individual) shrub-size data and performance of resampling. },

By building knowledge from information, data mining adds considerable value to the ever increasing stores of electronic data that abound today. In performing data mining many decisions need to be made regarding the choice of methodology, the choice of data, the choice of tools, and the choice of algorithms. Throughout this book the reader is introduced to the basic concepts and some of the more popular algorithms of data mining. With a focus on the hands-on end-to-end process for data mining, Williams guides the reader through various capabilities of the easy to use, free, and open source Rattle Data Mining Software built on the sophisticated R Statistical Software. The focus on doing data mining rather than just reading about data mining is refreshing. The book covers data understanding, data preparation, data refinement, model building, model evaluation, and practical deployment. The reader will learn to rapidly deliver a data mining project using software easily installed for free from the Internet. Coupling Rattle with R delivers a very sophisticated data mining environment with all the power, and more, of the many commercial offerings.},

  Abstract                 = {The emerging virus strain termed highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HP-H5N1) has spread widely in the past decade and is now the focus of considerable concern in several sectors. We tested the hypothesis that spatial distributions of veterinary and human HP-H5N1 cases are related to coarse-scale environmental features in West Africa. We used ecological niche models to associate Nigerian HP-H5N1 occurrences with 1 km resolution digital data layers summarizing parameters of surface reflectance and landform. Predictive challenges included anticipating the spatial distribution of (i) random subsamples and (ii) spatially and temporally stratified subsamples of Nigerian occurrence data, and (iii) more limited occurrence data from across West Africa. In almost all tests, we found that HP-H5N1 cases were occurring under predictable environmental conditions, suggesting that elements of the transmission cycle have some form of ecological determination, here measured as differences in land-surface reflectance and plant phenology through the year. Considerable additional work is needed to establish how these differences affect HP-H5N1 transmission. (C) 2008 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Background: The emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 ("HPAI-H5N1") has spread broadly in the past decade, and is now the focus of considerable concern. We tested the hypothesis that spatial distributions of HPAI-H5N1 cases are related consistently and predictably to coarse-scale environmental features in the Middle East and northeastern Africa. We used ecological niche models to relate virus occurrences to 8 km resolution digital data layers summarizing parameters of monthly surface reflectance and landform. Predictive challenges included a variety of spatial stratification schemes in which models were challenged to predict case distributions in broadly unsampled areas. Results: In almost all tests, HPAI-H5N1 cases were indeed occurring under predictable sets of environmental conditions, generally predicted absent from areas with low NDVI values and minimal seasonal variation, and present in areas with a broad range of and appreciable seasonal variation in NDVI values. Although we documented significant predictive ability of our models, even between our study region and West Africa, case occurrences in the Arabian Peninsula appear to follow a distinct environmental regime. Conclusion: Overall, we documented a variable environmental "fingerprint" for areas suitable for HPAI-H5N1 transmission. },

  Abstract                 = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) have been popularized by the work of Hastie and Tibshirani (Generalized Additive Models (1990)) and the availability of user friendly gam software in Splus. However, whilst it is flexible and efficient, the gam framework based on backfitting with linear smoothers presents some difficulties when it comes to model selection and inference. On the other hand, the mathematically elegant work of Wahba (Spline Models for Observational Data (1990)) and co-workers on Generalized Spline Smoothing (GSS) provides a rigorous framework for model selection (SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput. 12 (1991) 383) and inference with GAMs constructed from smoothing splines: but unfortunately these models are computationally very expensive with operations counts that are of cubic order in the number of data. A {'}middle way{'} between these approaches is to construct GAMs using penalized regression splines (e.g. Marx and Eilers, Comput. Statist. Data Anal. (1998)). In this paper, we develop this idea further and show how GAMs constructed using penalized regression splines can be used to get most of the practical benefits of GSS models, including well founded model selection and multi-dimensional smooth terms, with the ease of use and low computational cost of backfit GAMs. Inference with the resulting methods also requires slightly fewer approximations than are employed in the GAM modelling software provided in Splus. This paper presents the basic mathematical and numerical approach to GAMs implemented in the R package mgcv, and includes two environmental examples using the methods as implemented in the package. \copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Landscape ecology has made tremendous progress in recent decades, but as a rapidly developing discipline it is faced with new problems and challenges. To identify the key issues and research priorities in landscape ecology, a special session entitled "Top 10 List for Landscape Ecology in the 21st Century" was organized at the 16th Annual Symposium of the US Regional Association of International Association of Landscape Ecology, held at Arizona State University (Tempe, Arizona, USA) during April 25-29, 2001. A group of leading landscape ecologists were invited to present their views. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus, of the special session. We have organized the diverse and wide-ranging perspectives into six general key issues and 10 priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity, (2) integration between basic research and applications, (3) Conceptual and theoretical development, (4) education and training, (5) international scholarly communication and collaborations, and (6) outreach and communication with the public and decision makers. The top 10 research topics are: (1) ecological flows in landscape mosaics, (2) causes, processes, and consequences of land use and land cover change, (3) nonlinear dynamics and landscape complexity, (4) scaling, (5) methodological development, (6) relating landscape metrics to ecological processes, (7) integrating humans and their activities into landscape ecology, (8) optimization of landscape pattern, (9) landscape sustainability, and (10) data acquisition and accuracy assessment. We emphasize that, although this synthesis was based on the presentations at the "Top 10 List" session, it is not a document that has been agreed upon by each and every participant. Rather, we believe that it is reflective of the broad-scale vision of the collective as to where landscape ecology is now and where it may be going in future.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim To determine the potential combined effects of climate change and land transformation on the modelled geographic ranges of Banksia. Location Mediterranean climate South West Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Methods We used the species distribution modelling software Maxent to relate current environmental conditions to occurrence data for 18 Banksia species, and subsequently made spatial predictions using two simple dispersal scenarios (zero and universal), for three climate-severity scenarios at 2070, taking the impacts of land transformation on species{'} ranges into account. The species were chosen to reflect the biogeography of Banksia in the SWAFR. Results Climate-severity scenario, dispersal scenario, biogeographic distribution and land transformation all influenced the direction and magnitude of the modelled range change responses for the 18 species. The predominant response of species to all climate change scenarios was range contraction, with exceptions for some northern and widespread species. Including land transformation in estimates of modelled geographic range size for the three climate-severity scenarios generally resulted in smaller gains and larger declines in species ranges across both dispersal scenarios. Including land transformation and assuming zero dispersal resulted, as expected, in the greatest declines in projected range size across all species. Increasing climate change severity greatly increased the risk of decline in the 18 Banksia species, indicating the critical role of mitigating future emissions. Main conclusions The combined effects of climate change and land transformation may have significant adverse impacts on endemic Proteaceae in the SWAFR, especially under high emissions scenarios and if, as expected, natural migration is limiting. Although these results need cautious interpretation in light of the many assumptions underlying the techniques used, the impacts identified warrant a clear focus on monitoring across species ranges to detect early signs of change, and experiments that determine physiological thresholds for species in order to validate and refine the models.},

Redshank fed in a square metre of mud that had recently been exploited by another redshank much less often than would be expected by chance. By avoiding areas where prey would have been recently exploited, the feeding rate of redshank was up to three times faster than it would have been had they not avoided other foraging redshank. 3.

  Abstract                 = {Normative fish introductions disrupt ecosystem processes and can drive native species to local extinction. Two of the most widespread, introduced species are the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from Eurasia and the Nile tilapia (Oreochroniis niloticus) from Africa. In North and South America, these introductions stem from aquaculture facilities, as well as historical introductions for recreational angling. An emergent field of ecological niche modeling provides robust predictions of the geographic potential of alien species to better understand their capacity to become established at broad scales. We used this modeling approach to produce spatially explicit predictions of the invasive potential of common carp and Nile tilapia in the Americas. Model predictions were tested using occurrence data for established populations in their native area and in the Americas. Results indicated that predictive power of niche models was high. Distributional potential of common carp in the Americas covers most temperate regions and high mountain tropical aquatic systems, whereas that of Nile tilapia is focused in the tropics and coast areas. The consequences of the potential establishment of these exotic species can be profound on native aquatic faunas, particularly on highly diverse regions such as the Amazon Basin-and central Mexico.},

Model predictions, however, reflected the distributions of dairy cattle versus beef cattle, and the non-random nature of sampling any cattle, but did not succeed in detecting environmental correlates at spatial resolutions of 1 km. Given that the tests employed seek any predictivity better than random expectations, making the finding of no environmental associations conservative, we conclude that BTB prevalence is independent of coarse-scale environmental features. },

  Abstract                 = {Based on their extensive experience with teaching R and statistics to applied scientists, the authors provide a beginner{'}s guide to R. To avoid the difficulty of teaching R and statistics at the same time, statistical methods are kept to a minimum. The text covers how to download and install R, import and manage data, elementary plotting, an introduction to functions, advanced plotting, and common beginner mistakes. This book contains everything you need to know to get started with R. },

  Abstract                 = {This chapter gives a non-technical introduction into mixed modelling. Mixed models are also known as mixed effects models or multilevel models and are used when the data have some sort of hierarchical form such as in longitudinal or panel data, repeated measures, time series and blocked experiments, which can have both fixed and random coefficients together with multiple error terms. It can be an extremely useful tool, but is potentially difficult to understand and to apply. In this chapter, we explain mixed models with random intercept and slope, different variances, and with an auto-correlation structure. In the case study chapters, several examples are presented (Chapters 22, 23, 26, 35 and 37). Some of these chapters are within a linear modelling context, whereas others use smoothing methods leading to additive mixed modelling. In the time series analysis and spatial statistics chapters (16, 17 and 19), temporal and spatial correlation structure is added to the linear regression and smoothing models. All of these techniques can be seen as extensions of mixed modelling.},

McCullough: R can be used for reliable statistical computing, whereas most statistical and econometric software cannot. This is illustrated by the effect of abortion on crime. Koenker: Additive models provide a clever compromise between parametric and non-parametric components illustrated by risk factors for Indian malnutrition. Gelman: R graphics in the context of voter participation in US elections. Vinod: New solutions to the old problem of efficient estimation despite autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity among regression errors are proposed and illustrated by the Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Markus and Gu: New R tools for exploratory data analysis including bubble plots. Vinod, Hsu and Tian: New R tools for portfolio selection borrowed from computer scientists and data-mining experts, relevant to anyone with an investment portfolio. Foster and Kecojevic: Extends the usual analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) illustrated by growth charts for Saudi children. Imai, Keele, Tingley, and Yamamoto: New R tools for solving the age-old scientific problem of assessing the direction and strength of causation. Their job search illustration is of interest during current times of high unemployment. Haupt, Schnurbus, and Tschernig: consider the choice of functional form for an unknown, potentially nonlinear relationship, explaining a set of new R tools for model visualization and validation. Rindskopf: R methods to fit a multinomial based multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) with examples from psychology, sociology, political science, and medicine. Neath: R tools for Bayesian posterior distributions to study increased disease risk in proximity to a hazardous waste site. Numatsi and Rengifo: explain persistent discrete jumps in financial series subject to misspecification.},
